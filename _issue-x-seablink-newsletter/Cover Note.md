<p>Dear readers,</p>
<p>We hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. Since
our last communication, we are eager to bring you up to speed on our latest
developments.</p>
<p>2024 marks SEAB’s 20th anniversary since our founding on 1 April 2004.
This is a significant milestone in our journey. Two decades of unwavering
commitment to excellence and innovation in education assessment have not
only solidified SEAB’s position as a pillar of Singapore’s educational
landscape but also underscored our pivotal role in upholding the standards
of ingapore’s education.</p>
<p>This issue of SEAB-link highlights the exciting 20th anniversary events
held on 22 and 28 March 2024, which were celebrated with fervent enthusiasm
by SEAB staff and our stakeholders.</p>
<p>Our journey towards digitalisation continues to gain momentum. We made
strides in the 2023 national examinations for PSLE and locally administered
GCE-Level papers that have transitioned to onscreen marking (OSM). OSM
has reduced the PSLE marking days from four days to three. Markers of the
GCE O-Level Physics/Chemistry Practical examinations have also reported
encouraging feedback about their experience, which has contributed to their
professional development and assessment literacy.</p>
<p>In this era of rapid technological advancements, Singapore’s educational
landscape is undergoing a transformative evolution to equip learners with
21st Century Competencies (21CC). In alignment with this progression, SEAB
has developed Assessment for Learning tools. More recently, SEAB has launched
a Multistage Adaptive Testing tool called Read2LearnEL, a new computerised
classroom assessment test for English Reading Comprehension. MathsCheckPlus
and CATalytics offer a holistic approach to support teaching, learning
and assessment of Mathematics by providing teachers with valuable insights
of their students’ mastery and learning gaps, enabling them to tailor their
teaching methods accordingly. These innovations are testament to SEAB’s
dedication to actively explore innovative avenues to meet the evolving
needs of education.</p>
<p>This year, SEAB also organised our signature event, the biennial SEAB
Assessment Seminar. With a keen focus on nurturing the competencies vital
for 21st century learning in future-ready learners, the 2024 Assessment
Seminar drew significant interest from educators. Through engaging talks
and interactive sessions, participants delved into innovative approaches
that emphasise creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and communication
skills to empower the young minds of tomorrow.</p>
