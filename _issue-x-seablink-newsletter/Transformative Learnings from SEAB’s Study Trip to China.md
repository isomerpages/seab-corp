<p>In May 2024, Deputy Director, Research and Development Division, Dr Tay
Poh Hua, Deputy Director, Exam Operations Division, Mr Oliver Junus and
Assessment Officer (Sciences), Mr Tan Wee Siang went on a study trip to
China together with a group of colleagues from MOE. The aim of the trip
was to gain insights from technological companies, examinations authority,
local schools and universities, on the future possibilities that can be
afforded with the recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and
other educational technologies.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first leg of their study trip was in Hefei, with the initial stop
at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). The professors
at USTC inspired the group by sharing their commitment to developing talents
in science and technology. They discussed their efforts to integrate AI
into classrooms and equip students with a forward-looking mindset.</p>

<p><em>Mr Tan Wee Siang and Mr Tay Poh Hua took on the role of examination candidates sitting for e-oral examinations, which would later be auto-marked.&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>Next, the team visited iFLYTEK, a Chinese information technology company
known for its speech recognition technologies. There, they engaged in extensive
discussions and learnt about the potential of smart classrooms, optical
character recognition and auto-marking systems.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of the AI technologies used to facilitate learning and improve their
daily lives included the use of robots. The team had the opportunity to
play chess with an AI robot, and also got a ride on an AI-operated driverless
car on the busy streets of Hefei!</p>
<p>In Hefei, the team also visited Anhui Education Examinations Authority
(AEEA) to learn about their implementation of AI-based auto-marking to
supplement and enhance the accuracy of human marking of their <em>gaokao</em> (高考)
&nbsp;taken by 50,000 candidates in Anhui.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>The personnel at AEEA generously shared about their research and learning
process. It was especially heartening to hear them conclude that the application
of AI technologies has widened the possibilities of educational evaluation
and feedback, contributing to a more complete and holistic knowledge and
evaluation system.</p>

<p>The next leg of the study trip was in Shanghai where the team visited
East China Normal University and Shanghai University of Sport. Both institutions
shared about how they have developed their own AI programme to analyse
their sports students’ physical movements, providing real-time feedback
and suggestions for self-directed improvement.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>The highlight of the&nbsp;last leg of the trip in Hangzhou was a visit
to Alibaba’s headquarters. The personnel at Alibaba shared their latest
innovations and introduced a system used in many schools to allow educators
to monitor different aspects of education on a single platform. One of
the modules involved the use of AI-monitored cameras around the school
to detect abnormal or undesired behaviours like sleeping and irrelevant
chatting in classrooms.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The team deeply appreciated the warmth, generosity, professionalism and
comprehensive sharing of expertise and experiences by the organisations
and schools that they have visited. &nbsp;&nbsp;They left inspired and
excited about the AI possibilities that can be trialed and tested in the
years to come.</p>
