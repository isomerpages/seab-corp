<p>The transformative impact of onscreen marking (OSM) has been well established.
OSM streamlines the marking process, offering efficiency and accuracy from
when the scripts are received at SEAB to the conclusion of the whole marking
exercise. Not only can marking days be reduced, the number of markers can
also be reduced, freeing up valuable time for more teachers to focus on
teaching and learning with their students. Another important benefit from
OSM is the opportunity for markers to enhance their assessment literacy.</p>
<p>This article highlights the development of the OSM with the full rollout
in the PSLE, and the new GCE subjects which have transitioned to local
marking.</p>

<p>Since 2020, the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) marking has
progressively transited from paper-based marking to onscreen marking, starting
with Higher Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), Foundation MTL, Foundation Mathematics
and Foundation Science in 2020.&nbsp; In 2021, OSM was rolled out to MTL
subjects. This was followed by all other PSLE subjects in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By leveraging technology to improve the efficiency and quality of marking,
SEAB has vastly improved the experience of our marking personnel.</p>

<p><em>Marking personnel deeply engaged in the marking of PSLE papers</em>
</p>
<p>Most marking personnel welcome the use of OSM.&nbsp; Based on the online
survey of marking personnel in 2023, most markers expressed that OSM has
enabled them to be more focused on professional matters, and hence levelled
up their competency in assessment literacy.&nbsp; Table 1 below indicates
the markers’ ratings.</p>

<p>The following are some comments from the 2023 online survey:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>OSM is very efficient and accurate.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Online marking experience and learning are great. I would like to be back again.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The marking experience has helped me in my professional development.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Onscreen marking has eliminated the wait time and smoothened the process. Putting the rubrics and the standardised scripts in the system will help in better referencing while marking.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>OSM is user friendly.</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the use of OSM has saved time, manpower, and improved efficiency.
The number of marking days for all PSLE subjects was reduced from 4 days
to 3 days in 2023. There was also a 40% reduction of appointed markers,
compared to the number of markers appointed for paper-based marking. Compared
to paper-based marking, OSM significantly improves efficiency while maintaining
consistent marking quality.</p>
