description: About GCE O-Level
---
<p>The Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level
(GCE O-Level) examination is an annual national examination that is taken
by school and private candidates in Singapore.</p>
<p>More information about the GCE O-Level examination is available below.</p>
<p>The Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level
(GCE O-Level) examination was introduced in 1971. It was delinked from
the United Kingdom’s GCE O-Level examination in 2006, as part of the Ministry
of Education Singapore’s efforts to gain greater control of the management
of the examination. The GCE O-Level examination is closely aligned to the
Singapore school curriculum that is&nbsp;designed by the MOE.</p>
<p>The GCE O-Level examination is offered annually to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students from mainstream schools who are taking a Secondary Four Express
course or a Secondary Five Normal (Academic) course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private candidates who have met the eligibility criteria to register for
the GCE O-Level examination.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board, MOE and Cambridge International
Education are the joint examining authorities for the GCE O-Level examination.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Syllabus B</strong>
</p>
<p>The MTL Syllabus B subject is not a GCE O-Level subject, and the grade
will not be included in the computation of the candidate’s GCE O-Level
aggregate score. Candidates who pass the MTL Syllabus B subject will be
deemed to have fulfilled the MTL subject requirement for admission to junior
colleges.</p>
<p>The grade awarded for a respective MTL Syllabus B subject will be indicated
as Merit, Pass or Ungraded on the candidate’s certificate.</p>
<p><strong>O-Level School Initiated Electives (OSIE)</strong>
</p>
<p>The MOE introduced greater flexibility in the curriculum by giving secondary
schools the option to offer OSIE to build up their niche areas in 2005.</p>
<p>OSIE subjects are taken in addition to, or as replacements of, current
curriculum offerings by the MOE. They are examinable and the grades can
be used in the computation of the GCE O-Level aggregate scores for admission
to the junior colleges, centralised institutes and polytechnics.</p>
<p>School candidates can register for the examinations for the OSIE subjects
that have been approved by the MOE Curriculum Planning and Development
Division (CPDD) through their schools.</p>
<p><strong>Applied Subjects</strong>
</p>
<p>Applied Subjects are developed by the polytechnics in partnership with
the secondary schools to better cater to the interests and aspirations
of students who are&nbsp;keen to progress along an applied and practice-oriented
path of education since 2008.</p>
<p>They are examinable by the polytechnics and the grades can be used in
the computation of the GCE O-Level aggregate scores for admission to the
junior colleges, centralised institutes and polytechnics.</p>
<p>School candidates can register for the examinations for the Applied Subjects
that have been approved by the MOE CPDD through their schools.</p>
