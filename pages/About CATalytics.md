<p>CATalytics is a computerised adaptive test which assesses Primary 5 and
Primary 6 students’ proficiency in Standard Mathematics, based on the learning
outcomes in the MOE Primary School Mathematics syllabus.</p>
<p>CATalytics is designed to assess how well a student has achieved the learning
outcomes for a topic for his/her grade level. It is customised to the student’s
ability with items chosen such that the test is age appropriate without
being too challenging. The student’s performance is dependent on the difficulty
of the items he/she has attempted.</p>
<p>CATalytics is currently offered in 4 topics:</p>
<p>1. Decimals</p>
<p>2. Fractions</p>
<p>3. Geometry</p>
<p>4. Measurement and Area &amp; Volume</p>
<p>Each topical test consists of 30 multiple choice questions. Students are
given 1 hour to complete each test.</p>
<p>Schools can choose the number of topics they would like to sign up for.
If a school signs up for 4 topics, each student will take 4 topical tests.</p>
<h4>CATalytics for Teaching and Learning</h4>
<p>As a diagnostic tool, CATalytics' data and reports provide teachers with
targeted insights about students' prior knowledge and learning gaps. Teachers
can then develop focused remediation strategies and prepare appropriate
resources for effective intervention.</p>
<p>Here is some feedback from teachers on how they have used CATalytics reports
to enhance their teaching and learning.</p>
<h4>CATalytics Reports</h4>
<p>The CATalytics reports comprise:</p>
<p>1. Group Profile Report (by school and class)</p>
<p>2. Student Profile Report</p>
<p>3. Profile Descriptors</p>
<p>4. Common Error Analysis</p>
<p>They provide information on the learning outcomes that students can manage,
can partially manage, and cannot manage.</p>
