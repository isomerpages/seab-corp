<p>MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup> is designed for Primary 2 and 4 students to identify
students’ learning gaps using skills descriptors and is closely aligned
with the MOE Primary School Mathematics syllabus.</p>
<p>P2 MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup> is a computerised linear test, where questions
are presented to students in a fixed, sequential order.</p>
<p>P4 MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup> is a Multistage Adaptive Test (MST). It provides
a customised test experience as it adjusts the test difficulty according
to the student’s performance during the test. Students are given approximately
1 hour to complete the test.</p>
<h4>MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup> for Teaching and Learning  </h4>
<p>SEAB collaborates with Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) to conduct
workshops for MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup> Champions from participating schools.</p>
<p>AST’s Master Teachers use the insights from MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup> reports
to develop classroom strategies to close students’ learning gaps. The workshops
are a valuable platform for teachers to understand their students’ learning
difficulties and learn good practices from colleagues from other schools.</p>
<h4>MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup> Reports</h4>
<p>A School Report and a Class Report will be provided.</p>
<p><strong>School Report</strong>
</p>
<p>The School Report provides a holistic overview of students’ performance
at the school level. It provides a qualitative comparison of students’
performance against the national average performance. If the school participates
in MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup> for three consecutive years, the School Report
also provides trend information.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Class Report</strong>
</p>
<p>The class report informs teachers about each student’s mastery of Mathematical
skills and topics.</p>
<p>Teachers can use the information to identify students who need greater
support, and craft class-level and cohort-level remediation strategies.</p>

<h4>Progression from MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup> to CATalytics</h4>
<p>Using the insights from P4 MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup>, teachers can identify
students who need additional support in specific topics and use CATalytics
to pinpoint exact learning gaps. This targeted approach also enables teachers
to provide more targeted intervention and check how students are managing
a topic post-intervention.</p>
<p>Please refer to the infographic below for an overview of how MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup> and
<a href="https://seab.gov.sg/assessment-for-learning-afl-tools/about-catalytics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CATalytics</a>can be used in tandem to support students’ Mathematical
development throughout their primary school years.</p>
