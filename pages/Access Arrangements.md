<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>Access Arrangements (AA) are granted by the Singapore Examinations and
Assessment Board (SEAB) to candidates with specific physical and learning
disabilities to enable them to sit the national examinations without compromising
assessment objectives. These arrangements may include the provision of
extra time, a separate room, enlarged print for the candidate's examination
papers, or an exemption from specific components of an examination.</p>
<p>AA is extended to these candidates because the standardised testing conditions
may result in them receiving an inadequate assessment of their abilities
or them being unable to take the examinations altogether.</p>

<summary><strong>GUIDING PRINCIPLES</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>All candidates are assessed according to the same marking criteria, to
ensure that the grades and examination certificates have the same validity
for all candidates.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hence, AA must not provide candidates with an advantage over the others
and compromise the assessment objectives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When determining the appropriate Access Arrangements (AA) for a candidate,
the primary consideration is how the student typically learns and functions
in the classroom, based on the school’s observations. While the candidate's
specific learning needs, physical needs, or medical conditions are important
factors, the AA provided would align with the candidate’s usual way of
learning. Additional inputs, such as recommendations from doctors and medical
professionals will be taken into consideration during the review. This
approach ensures that the AA provided is both appropriate for the candidate
and fair to all candidates.</p>
