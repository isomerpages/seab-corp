<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>Access Arrangements (AA) are granted by the Singapore Examinations and
Assessment Board (SEAB) to candidates with special educational needs (SEN),
including those with specific physical and learning disabilities. AA is
granted<em> </em>to enable these candidates sit the national examinations
without compromising assessment objectives. AA are extended to these candidates
because the standardised testing conditions may result in them receiving
an inadequate assessment of their abilities or being unable to take the
examinations altogether.</p>
<p>These arrangements may include the provision of extra time, a separate
room, enlarged print for the candidate's examination papers, or an exemption
from specific components of an examination.</p>

<summary><strong>GUIDING PRINCIPLES</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>All candidates are assessed according to the same marking criteria, to
ensure that the grades and examination certificates have the same validity
for all candidates.</p>
<p></p>
<p>AA must not provide candidates with an advantage over others and compromise
the assessment objectives. For example, in Mathematics and Science examinations,
human Readers may be approved for candidates with dyslexia to enable them
to demonstrate problem-solving skills when reading difficulties impede
access to these competencies. However, Readers are not allowed for Language
papers, as language examinations inherently assess reading comprehension
and language processing skills, and human intonation would fundamentally
alter what is being assessed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When evaluating AA applications, the primary considerations are the candidate's
diagnosed conditions, and the school's observations of how the candidate
typically learns and functions in the classroom.<em> </em>Additional inputs
such as recommendations from qualified professionals will be considered
during the review. The Ministry of Education (MOE) and SEAB work closely
with schools, parents, and qualified professionals to monitor and review
candidates' needs, with the goal of providing appropriate support to candidates
to demonstrate their learning mastery fairly while maintaining the integrity
of the certification.</p>

<summary><strong>APPLICATION OUTCOME</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>If your AA application is accepted for processing, it will be subjected
to a rigorous review by a panel and be considered based on its circumstances.
The processing time depends on factors including the complexity of the
AA requested for and the timely submission of all supporting documents.
Certain types of AA requests such as the use of a Reader, Practical Assistant,
Scribe, or Word Processor may take longer time to process.
<br>
<br>Your AA application outcome will be released via the following platforms:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If you are a school candidate, your school will inform you of the outcome.
If your AA application is submitted by the deadline, your outcome will
usually be released by April of your examination year.
<br>
<br>Following the release of your AA application outcome, your schools may
work with you to trial your approved accommodations during your daily teaching
and learning sessions to better prepare you for your national examinations.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are a private candidate, please access the Candidates Portal to
view your outcome. If your AA application is submitted by the deadline,
your outcome will usually be released by June of your examination year.
<br>
<br>Following the release of your outcome, you and/or your parents could consider
trialing the approved AAs where feasible, to enhance your examination preparation.
