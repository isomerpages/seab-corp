<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>Access Arrangements (AA) are granted by the Singapore Examinations and
Assessment Board (SEAB) to candidates with specific physical and learning
disabilities to enable them to sit the national examinations without compromising
assessment objectives. These arrangements may include the provision of
extra time, a separate room, enlarged print for the candidate's examination
papers, or an exemption from specific components of an examination.</p>
<p>AA is extended to these candidates because the standardised testing conditions
may result in them receiving an inadequate assessment of their abilities
or them being unable to take the examinations altogether.</p>

<summary><strong>GUIDING PRINCIPLES</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>All candidates are assessed according to the same marking criteria, to
ensure that the grades and examination certificates have the same validity
for all candidates.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hence, AA must not provide candidates with an advantage over the others
and compromise the assessment objectives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When determining the appropriate Access Arrangements (AA) for a candidate,
the primary consideration is how the student typically learns and functions
in the classroom, based on the school’s observations. While the candidate's
specific learning needs, physical needs, or medical conditions are important
factors, the AA provided would align with the candidate’s usual way of
learning. Additional inputs, such as recommendations from doctors and medical
professionals will be taken into consideration during the review. This
approach ensures that the AA provided is both appropriate for the candidate
and fair to all candidates.</p>

<p>SEAB will only accept AA applications for physical injuries sustained
just before or during the national examinations, and for conditions mentioned
above that were triggered by the onset of these physical injuries.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>
</p>
<p>If your AA application is submitted late and is rejected by SEAB, you
cannot apply special consideration (SC) for the same medical condition.</p>
<p><strong><u>Application Outcome</u></strong>
</p>
<p>If your AA application is accepted for processing, it will be subjected
to a rigorous review by a panel and be considered based on its circumstances.
Your AA application outcome will be released via the following platforms,
within two months from the date of your application’s submission.</p>
<p>If you are a school candidate, your school will inform you of the outcome.
Following the release of your AA application outcome, your schools may

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>If the AA results in significant modifications to your examinations, your
examination certificates and result slips will have either of these annotation
symbols placed next to your subject(s) that had the approved AA:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exemption Symbol (#) - </strong>'The
candidate was exempted from satisfying the full range of assessment objectives
in this subject.’</p>

candidate sat for the paper under access arrangements.’</p>
<p>The following AAs granted to candidates during the examinations will be
annotated:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extra time allowance (including silent reading /
preparation for oral examination);</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exemption from satisfying the full range of assessment
objectives in a subject (e.g. exemption from oral, listening comprehension
examinations);</p>

<p>The annotations are necessary to indicate factually that you had taken
the national examinations under conditions that are different from the
standard prescribed conditions, to uphold the integrity and fairness of
the examination. Your examination certificate will not have the details
of the AA. SEAB does not share the details of your granted AA with any
third parties.</p>
<p>You can request to withdraw the approved AA and this must be submitted
within the stipulated timelines (see section below). Otherwise, your examination
certificates and result slips will be annotated, even if you do not utilise
your approved AA during your coursework or examinations.</p>
