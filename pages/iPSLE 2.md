<p>The Singapore International Primary&nbsp;School Examination (𝑖PSLE) is
the international&nbsp;version of Singapore's Primary School Leaving Examination
(PSLE). The 𝑖PSLE was introduced with the aim of allowing overseas schools
to benchmark their academic standards against Singapore's standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A total of four subjects are offered to students taking the PSLE, namely
English Language, Mathematics, Science and Chinese Language. Students may
register for a minimum of one subject. The formats are similar to those
of the Singapore PSLE.</p>
