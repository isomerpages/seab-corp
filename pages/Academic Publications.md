<p>The first book to explore the development of Singapore's much-talked-about
education and examination system, this volume juxtaposes examinations with
its immediate context of education and wider context of politics, economy
and society.</p>
<p>The study covers three broad historical periods: Examinations in Singapore
from 1891 to 1945; The Post-War Years from 1946 to the 1970s; and Charting
Our Destiny from the 1980s to 2007. In the British period up to 1941, the
local examinations were conducted by the vernacular schools, and external
examinations by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate.
There was a lack of systematic effort to establish a uniform system of
education and examinations.</p>
<p>During the Japanese Occupation, examinations were conducted by the Japanese
authorities and, unexpectedly, the Cambridge examinations continued in
the Sime Road Camp.</p>
<p>In the post-war period and particularly after Singapore was granted self-government,
the establishment of a national education system was followed by the emergence
of national examinations: the Primary School Leaving Examinations and the
Singapore-Cambridge GCE N/O/A Levels for every school-going child in Singapore.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the nature of national examinations evolved with the changing
needs of education and the nation. At the turn of the century, with the
Ministry of Education's decision to take greater control of examinations,
the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board was established, to oversee
new developments in examinations. (Description from <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/6773" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>WorldScientific.com</u></a>)</p>
