<h3><strong>Procedures To Obtain Past Years' Examination Results</strong></h3>
<p>As examination certificates and result slips are controlled documents,
no replacements
<br>will be issued if you lose them. You can now obtain your examinations
results online at no cost.</p>
<p>If you have misplaced your PSLE certificate and require a copy for your
child's Primary 1 registration, you may register using a copy of your digitised
PSLE results.</p>
<h3><strong>Digitised Examination Results Through MySkillsFuture Portal</strong></h3>
<p>Past years' PSLE results from 1976 and GCE-Level examination results from
1975 are available in digital form at no cost. They can be retrieved online
through the MySkillsFuture portal or mobile application (see Table 1 below).
You would need a Singpass account for access.</p>
<p>The digitised results are secured with tamper-resistant encryptions and
allow for secure verification. Any modified document(s) will fail the verification
process and will be flagged as being tampered with.</p>
