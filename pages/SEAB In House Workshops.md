<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Certificate in Examination and Assessment in Education (CEA in Edn) is
part of the SkillsFuture for Educators (SFEd) Professional Development
roadmap designed to support in-service teachers in their continuing professional
growth in the area of Assessment Literacy.</p>
<h3><strong>Programme Structure and Objectives</strong></h3>
<p>CEA in Edn was designed to develop teachersâ€™ thought leadership in making
decisions and recommendations in their context to address diverse assessment
issues both in their daily classroom assessments and school-wide approach
to assessment. It is anchored on reflective practice enriched by critical
engagement with established and new strategies and methods generated from
the programme content, interactions with fellow educators and performance
in the assignments after the completion of the instructional units of each
module. It aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>help teachers to explore and apply established and new assessment strategies
and methods on individual students, class assessments and level-wide implementations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integrate new approaches in their own assessment practices; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>demonstrate their professional development as reflective leaders and informed
practitioners in assessment within the teaching fraternity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Criteria for Certificate Award</strong></h3>
<p>Based on the SkillsFuture model, the programme comprises stackable modules
to give teachers greater flexibility to choose the modules to attend within
3 years from attending the first module. To be awarded the Certificate
for CEA in Edn, teachers would have to complete two core and one elective
modules and the Capstone Assignment within the 3 years validity period.
This adds up to 104 hours for the whole programme.</p>
