<p>In 2027, the Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate Education (GCE) for
the N(T), N(A) and Ordinary Levels will be combined and renamed as the
Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) in line with
the implementation of Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB). More information
about the FSBB can found on <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">MOE's website</a>.</p>
<p>Under the SEC examination, students will sit the subjects at the respective
subject level (i.e. G1, G2, G3). The&nbsp;SEC will continue to be jointly
examined and awarded by the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board
(SEAB), Ministry of Education (MOE), Singapore, and Cambridge International
Education, United Kingdom. Students will receive an SEC that reflects the
subjects and subject levels that they sat for.</p>
<p>There is no change in the overall standards of examinations under the
SEC, and the qualification continues to be recognised locally and internationally.</p>

using grades of subjects taken at more demanding levels for purposes of
post-secondary progression, e.g. ELMAB3 for admission to Year 2 of Higher
Nitec (HN) and Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP), ELR2B2 for polytechnic
admissions.

<p>In situations where the grade of a G3 subject needs to be mapped to that
of a G1 subject for progression purposes, the grade of the G3 subject will
be first mapped to that of a G2 subject. Thereafter, the mapped grade for
the G2 subject will be further mapped to the grade of a G1 subject.</p>
