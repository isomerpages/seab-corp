<p>Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup> is a computerised English reading comprehension
test developed collaboratively by SEAB, the English Language Institute
of Singapore (ELIS), and the MOE Curriculum Planning &amp; Development
Division.</p>
<p>It assesses students’ competencies to make inferences, and retrieve, interpret,
and evaluate information when reading literary and informational texts.</p>
<p>The Multistage Adaptive Test (MST) design in this tool delivers a customised
test experience where the difficulty of the assessment is adjusted based
on student’s ability during the test.</p>
<p>Currently, it is offered at the beginning of Primary 5 to assess Primary
4 competencies. Conducted between January to February each year, we encourage
the whole Primary 5 cohort (both Standard and Foundation English) to participate.</p>
<p>Students are given approximately 1 hour to take the test.</p>
<h4>Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup> for Teaching and Learning</h4>
<p>As a diagnostic tool, Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup> provides teachers with detailed
information on students’ manageability of learning outcomes in the Reading

<p>Participating schools can take part in the Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup> Networked-Learning
Community (NLC) that is jointly facilitated by SEAB and ELIS.</p>
<p>As an NLC member, teachers will be supported in their learning to:</p>
<p>1. build and demonstrate knowledge and understanding of how to diagnose
students’ learning needs by using Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup> data</p>
<p>2. inquire into their formative assessment practices using Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup> data</p>
