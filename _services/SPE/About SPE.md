<p>The Supplementary Placement Exercise (SPE) is a centralised merit-based
placement exercise conducted for Returning Singaporeans (RS) who wish to
join a secondary school at Secondary 1, 2 or 3 at the beginning of the
next academic year. Applicants can apply for the SPE if they are unable
to make it back to Singapore in time for the School Placement Exercise
for Returning Singaporeans-Secondary (SPERS-Sec) that typically takes place
in September.</p>
<p>It is not compulsory and does not guarantee admission to the school of
choice. It is intended for those who prefer the convenience of a centralised
placement exercise.</p>
<p>MOE has commissioned SEAB to conduct the registration and test administration
of this exercise.</p>
