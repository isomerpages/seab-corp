<p>The GCE N(A)/N(T)/O/A-Level oral examinations have been streamlined, resulting
in a significant reduction in the overall number of examination days and
related resources.</p>
<p>GCE N(A)/N(T)/O/A-Level oral examinations have long been held in the afternoons,
taking up a total of 23 school days. Similarly, the GCE A-Level oral examinations
were also held over 10 school days in the afternoons. Since 2024, this
has now reduced to just three full days and nine afternoons for GCE N(A)/N(T)/O-Level
and for A-level, four full days and two afternoons.</p>
<p>A review was made in 2022 to reduce teachers’ workload and help schools
to optimise resources. With schools utilising the Home-Based Learning (HBL)
approach more extensively, this created an opportunity to introduce an
arrangement to conduct oral examinations in a short window of time, while
students do not lose curriculum time.</p>
<p>For the GCE A-Level oral examinations, all Junior Colleges (JC) and Millenia
Institute (MI) were divided into two groups and conducting examination
over a three-day period, effectively reducing the oral period by 7 days
for each group.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than reducing the number of oral examination days, the change resulted
in the following benefits:
<br>
<br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free up teachers’ time and resources
in schools, allowing for better utilisation in teaching, learning and other
school activities including co-curricular activities, National school games
and Singapore Youth Festival. &nbsp;Oral examiners travel on fewer days
to the examination centres, cutting stress and carbon emissions as well.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gain economies of scale with resource
optimisation in terms of manpower and spaces required, also reducing exam
administrative load.</p>
<p>Prior to the implementation, engagement sessions with MOE and schools
were conducted in 2022 to gather feedback. Approval was obtained from MOE
for a phased implementation in 2024 and 2025, and school leaders were informed
of the implementation plan in 2023 followed by regular updates.</p>
<p>The successful implementation in 2024 is attributed to the strong support
and cooperation of schools and teachers.&nbsp; It could only be implemented
with the sufficient number of teachers as Oral examiners. SEAB will complete
the implementation in 2025 with the GCE N(A)/N(T)/O-Levels in a single
window for all subjects (conducting O-level Mother Tongue Language with
the rest).</p>
<p>The survey feedback from oral examiners was positive:</p>
<p><strong>95% Oral Examiners were happy with the new oral exam arrangement.</strong>
