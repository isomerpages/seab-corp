<p>As SEAB celebrates its 20th anniversary, this series of articles highlights
the board’s key milestones in 2024. They reinforce SEAB’s commitment to
innovation, sustainability, and service excellence. Read on to find out
more.</p>

<h4>SEAB Building Achieves Remarkable Sustainability Milestone</h4>
<p>SEAB Building has achieved a re-certification as a Green Mark Platinum
(Super Low Energy) Building by the Building and Construction Authority
(BCA) in August 2024. The recertification is valid until August 2027. Led
by the Office and Estate Management Department, the recertification reflects
SEAB’s commitment to creating a sustainable future.</p>

<p>SEAB Building features a passive architectural design where the orientation
of the external and internal facades was deliberately designed to minimise
heat retention, keeping the building cool. The building also features a
biophilic design, with extensive use of greenery throughout the building,
externally and internally. These have created an overall green plot ratio
of 8.46 (i.e. the total leaf area from all plants is about 8.46 times the
site area) for the development. The greenery has also helped to reduce
the heat effect and cool the building further.</p>
<p>SEAB has also made significant improvements in the building’s energy and
water efficiency. Compared to 2021, energy and water use in 2024 were lowered
by 3.8% and 22.4% respectively, despite an increase in footfall in SEAB.
The features include:</p>
<p>a. A high efficiency water-cooled central cooling system. The chiller
plant and cooling towers are located at the rooftop level to minimise condenser
pressure loss and achieve optimal chiller plant efficiency.</p>
<p>b. Instruments to recycle condensate water from the air-conditioning system
to supplement the water used in the central cooling system, and rainwater
to irrigate the green spaces.</p>
<p>c. Solar panels installed on the rooftop to offset electricity consumption.</p>

<p>Collaborative efforts across our organisation have also further enhanced
our sustainability initiatives to promote environmental consciousness and
reduce the use of single-use items and waste. Our staff are adopting more
eco-friendly practices, such as using reusable utensils and bringing their
own water bottles to meetings and events. They have also been encouraging
visitors, including examination personnel to do the same. We have also
piloted a hybrid approach to food catering for workshops and training sessions,
comprising a mixed provision of catered food and snack packs.</p>
