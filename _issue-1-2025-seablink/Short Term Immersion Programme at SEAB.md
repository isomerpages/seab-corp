<p>The Short-Term Immersion Programme (STIP) is a Whole-Of-Government initiative
for public service officers.&nbsp; It aims to provide experiential opportunities
for officers to gain insights to the work of other public agencies, deepen
and broaden competencies and professional networks, as well as inject fresh
perspectives into officers’ core work and day-to-day work processes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>SEAB hosted a series of STIP opportunities in 2024, where participating
officers were assigned to the Exam Operations Division. Each run of the
STIP was for two weeks, during which the officers were exposed to the examination
operations, specifically the management of answer scripts. These officers
gained first-hand experience and understood the challenges in the management
of National Examination operations. Upon completion of their STIP, we took
the opportunity to ask some of them about their experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Ms Khairunnisa Abdul Khalid | Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura&nbsp;</h4>
<p>“I am a member of the Madrasah Policy and Planning Unit of the Majlis
Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), and the unit oversees the planning and policy
for the six Madrasahs in Singapore which adopt the dual curriculum. I believe
that this immersion is timely as my unit was also embarking on a similar
digitisation project. I am looking forward to share with my unit what I
have learnt here to elevate the learning process in my organisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work culture in SEAB exudes positive culture. It was memorable for
me to witness a lot of people supporting each other to ensure that the
results processing is on time and accurate. Colleagues here are forward-looking
and have embarked on using new technologies to ensure that the results
processing is more efficient. I have gained insights to the digitisation
process using cutting edge technology and I am also amazed by the growth
mindset that was adopted by the team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am truly excited to bring back what I have learnt in SEAB to MUIS so
that my team can also adopt the similar mindset and embrace technology
at its fullest.”&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Mr Lan Yingjie | Ministry of Education&nbsp;</h4>
<p>“I am currently a Special Assistant with the School Operations Policy
Branch in Ministry of Education, Headquarters (MOE HQ) whereby we support
the operationalisation of broader education policies. Prior to this, I
was a teacher in schools and had performed the role of a Presiding Examiner
and invigilator for the national examinations. I chose to do this STIP
because I wanted to know more about the processes involved in the running
of the national examinations, especially behind-the-scenes processes after
observing examinations in school during challenging times like the COVID-19
period.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Being involved in the digitisation and processing of papers was a very
memorable experience for me. I have come to realise that it is not an easy
task to account for all the papers considering the volume of papers that
are received from all the schools in Singapore. I observed the coordination
and the hard work displayed by the team and was impressed by how the team
pulled it off in a very well-polished and clockwork manner.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have gained a better understanding of the challenges that SEAB faces
as a partner to MOE HQ and the schools. Through this STIP, I am better
able to appreciate how SEAB aimed to design and implement processes with
stakeholders in mind. In addition, I have gained a deeper understanding
of assessment beyond the perspective of a teacher in school. I think SEAB
is very forward-looking and innovative and I look forward to seeing these
innovations benefitting the schools and students in the future.”&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Mr Sandeep Shetty | Monetary Authority of Singapore&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>“</strong>I am currently performing the role of a Lead Application
Delivery Manager (ADM) who oversees the end-to-end delivery of software
applications, managing the entire application lifecycle from requirements
definition and tender procurement through to build, test, deployment, and
maintenance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I chose SEAB for my immersion to gain more insights into the conduct and
execution of the National Examinations. With my background, I hope I will
also be able to provide suggestions to the SEAB team to further improve
on their current processes.</p>
<p>I was particularly impressed by the seamless coordination among the members
of the SEAB team during the PSLE period. I remembered how officers from
various SEAB departments came together, demonstrating exceptional teamwork
and dedication. I have learnt the importance of cross-departmental collaboration
in handling high-stakes situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The STIP experience provided me with invaluable insights to the intricacies
of education administration, particularly in the context of national examinations.
I gained a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of organising
such large-scale events. Specifically, I enhanced my skills in:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Crisis management: Observing how the team managed unexpected situations
had taught me the importance of quick decision-making and adaptability.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stakeholder management: The experience improved my ability to balance
the needs of various stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management: The strategies I observed for coordinating large-scale
operations can be applied to enhance the efficiency of projects in my department.
For example, I plan to implement a similar system of regular, brief check-ins
during critical phases in my next project.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Ms Lee Huixian&nbsp;| Building and Construction Authority&nbsp;</h4>
<p>“I work in the Procurement Policies Department in the Building and Construction
Authority (BCA), and my team is responsible for implementing procurement
policies for the construction and Facility Management sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advertisement for this STIP caught my eye because as a Singaporean
student who had gone through a few rounds of National Examination, I was
intrigued and interested to go behind-the-scenes of what happens before
and after the National Examinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this STIP, I had the opportunity to see the end-to-end processes
of script management and saw how efficiently and securely the scripts were
managed. I was also impressed by the exhibitions in the Heritage Gallery,
where I learnt about the evolution of our National Examinations over the
past few decades in Singapore. During my short two-week stint in SEAB,
I have gained a new-found appreciation for SEAB's efforts in safeguarding
the integrity of our National Exams and accounting for each script. SEAB's
devotion in continuously innovating and exploring new ways to enhance the
quality of our National Examinations and assessment standards is inspiring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing the crucial role that SEAB plays in our education system has reminded
me of the broader impact of our work in the public service. This motivates
me to continue improving our procurement policies for the benefit of all
government agencies.”&nbsp;</p>
