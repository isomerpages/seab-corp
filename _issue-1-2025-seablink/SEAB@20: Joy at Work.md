<h4><strong>SEAB FunFest 2024: A Carnival of Celebration, Charity, and Appreciation</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>This is the first year in which SEAB’s Active Day took on a different
approach where elements of family and charity were incorporated.&nbsp;
SEAB celebrated both the nation's 59<sup>th</sup> birthday and SEAB's 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary
with a FunFest Carnival and Charity Bazaar held at our premises. The event
provided a unique opportunity to strengthen bonds within the extended SEAB
family, as staff were encouraged to bring their families along for a warm,
fun-filled gathering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the festivities, personnel who have served as Mother Tongue
Language moderators for over 10 years were recognised and appreciated at
the event for their invaluable contributions to the development of examination
papers.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Old Shoe, New Future: Giving Footwear a Second Life Through Recycling</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Between August and September 2024, an initiative to collect used shoes
from staff with the goal of repurposing them for various sustainable uses
was launched. Partnering with Cloop/APSN, an enterprise focused on reducing
fashion overconsumption and waste, SEAB successfully collected 108 pairs
of footwear, underscoring its commitment to sustainability and responsible
resource management. The collected footwear was sent to Cloop's sorting
facilities, where they would be upcycled into materials for fitness corners,
playgrounds, and jogging lanes. SEAB’s participation in this sustainability
cause not only supports environmental stewardship but also promotes the
creative reuse of materials in innovative ways. &nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Packing with Purpose: Essential Medical Supplies for Dialysis Patients</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>SEAB staff engaged in a meaningful volunteering initiative with the National
Kidney Foundation, which involved packing essential medical supplies for
dialysis patients. This effort played a crucial role in supporting those
who rely on regular dialysis treatments to manage their kidney health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dedicated volunteers from various SEAB divisions came together on an afternoon
to pack essential medical supplies with care. SEAB is proud to have contributed
to this important cause, while fostering teamwork and strengthening our

<h4><strong>A Joyful Giving: SEAB’s School Readiness Bag Initiative for Students in Need</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In 2024, SEAB embarked on a new corporate social responsibility effort
and partnered with Project Hills to support the 'Sponsor a School Readiness
Bag' initiative. Project Hills is a ground-up initiative that offers various
forms of support to families living in public rental housing estates around
Singapore. This ground-up effort holds even greater meaning as it directly
benefits the students, allowing SEAB to give back to the community in a
truly impactful way. It was a resounding success, raising $4,120 through
generous donations from SEAB staff, which helped provide 50 school readiness
bags for less privileged students, ranging from preschoolers to students
in Institutes of Higher Learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEAB staff came together to volunteer, packing the 50 bags with essential
school supplies and.&nbsp; then distributed the bags to the recipients.
On the day of the bag distribution, the recipients’ faces were beaming
with joy as they received their bags. With these thoughtful contributions,
SEAB’s efforts have given these students a good reason to look forward
to their new school year.&nbsp;</p>
