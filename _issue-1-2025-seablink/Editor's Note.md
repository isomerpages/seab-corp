<p>Dear readers,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy New Year 2025! We hope this message finds you refreshed and ready
for another exciting year ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are delighted to present our latest newsletter, which not only highlights
significant developments and achievements at SEAB but also debuts in a
brand-new format. We have transitioned from our PDF format to webpages,
offering a more interactive and accessible reading experience. This new
format allows for easier navigation, embedded multimedia content such as
videos, and improved readability across various devices. In addition, we
have taken advantage of web technologies to suggest relevant content for
selected articles for you to explore the topic further.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEAB commemorates our 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary in 2024. It is thus fitting
that we share a heartwarming glimpse into the various&nbsp; activities
held in 2024 to commemorate our 20th anniversary, arranged thematically
under ‘Joy At Work’ and ‘Pride In Work’, Under the “Joy At Work” series,
SEAB staff were engaged in a series of meaningful corporate social responsibility
and team bonding activities that brought us closer as an organisation as
well as reinforced the sense of purpose and joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under "Pride in Work", we share the substantial progress in both our examination
processes and corporate initiatives, demonstrating our commitment to innovation
and excellence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In line with our digital transformation efforts, we have successfully
implemented e-Examinations for N(A) Social Studies, N(T) Science, and N(T)
Basic Mother Tongue Language in 2024. This initiative represents a significant
step forward in modernising our assessment methods and preparing students
for an increasingly digital world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage you to explore our new web-based newsletter and delve into
the articles to gain a deeper understanding of these exciting developments.
They reflect the joy we find in our work and the pride we take in our continuous
improvement and innovation. We hope you enjoy reading this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, &nbsp;
