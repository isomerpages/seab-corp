<p>SEAB was honoured to be invited by the Collaborative Innovation Center
of Assessment for Basic Education Quality at Beijing Normal University
to participate in the 7<sup>th</sup> International Conference on Education
Evaluation and Monitoring, held on 10-11 December 2024 at Beijing Normal
University, China.</p>
<p>The theme of the conference was “Future-oriented Education Evaluation
and Monitoring”. Over the course of the two days, researchers from educational
research departments, educational administration departments, scientific
research departments, and universities from different countries gathered
to present and discuss advancements in the digital transformation of educational
assessment. The conference provided a valuable platform for sharing insights
on how technology is reshaping the landscape of education evaluation globally.
Dr Koh Poh Wee, Research Specialist from SEAB’s Research and Development
Division, presented SEAB’s efforts in using adaptive testing in English
reading comprehension at the conference.</p>
<p>As part of the conference, Dr Koh also had the opportunity to engage in
an academic exchange with peers from the language divisions of the Collaborative
Innovation Center of Assessment for Basic Education Quality in Beijing.
They discussed ideas and best practices in using technology and artificial
intelligence to assess core educational competencies. The dialogue offered
fresh perspectives on how AI could be leveraged to enhance educational
assessment practices.</p>
<p>Through participation in this conference, SEAB gained valuable insights
into:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Global advancements in personalised assessments: How advancements
have been made around the world with the greater emphasis on personalising
assessments for students, and how they could be adapted and applied in
the Singaporean context,</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; New perspectives on large-scale assessments: Emerging
ways to analyse trends and patterns in results of large-scale assessments
such as PISA and TIMMS, offering a deeper understanding of global educational
outcomes</p>
<p>Overall, this conference was a valuable opportunity for SEAB to exchange
ideas with global leaders in educational assessment, reinforcing SEAB’s
commitment to continuously improve assessment practices in Singapore’s
education system.</p>
