<p>On 4 March2024, 31 key personnel and teachers from the West 3 (W3) Cluster
participated in a half-day workshop conducted by SEAB at Frontier Primary
School. Titled “<em>Strengthening 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies (CC) through Assessment as Learning (AaL)</em>”,
the workshop was adapted from an established in-house training programme,
the workshop delved into the concepts, principles, and practical applications
of AaL to enhance students’ 21CC. The primary goal was to deepen participants’
understanding of how AaL fosters self-awareness, self-reflection and self-regulation
- crucial metacognitive processes for cultivating the skills essential
to current and future success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This workshop was part of SEAB’s broader outreach initiatives to support
schools in implementing the Ministry of Education’s Enhanced Framework
for 21CC, with greater emphasis on adaptive and inventive thinking, effective
communication and civic literacy.&nbsp;</p>
