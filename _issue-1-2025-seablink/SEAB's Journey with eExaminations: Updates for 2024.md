<p>Digital literacy has been integrated into teaching and learning to prepare
our students for future work. Taking alignment with this, e-Examinations
was introduced in 2013 to provide students with a more relevant, authentic
and engaging assessment experience. e-Examinations also offer personalisation
and assess skills and knowledge that traditional pen-and-paper methods
cannot.</p>
<p>In 2024, three more subjects were assessed electronically- N(A)-Level
Social Studies, N(T)-Level Science, and N(T)-Level Basic Mother Tongue
Languages.</p>
<p>As with any new subjects that were brought onboard e-Examinations, efforts
were made to ensure a smooth transition for both educators and students.
To this end, SEAB proactively</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>engaged with stakeholders prior to the implementation. Consultations and
feedback sessions were conducted via focus groups and school visits, involving
school leaders, key school personnel, and teachers; &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>organised training workshops and briefings for teachers, equipping them
with the necessary knowledge and skills for the setup and conduct of the
e-Examinations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provided media resources such as online guides to familiarise educators
and students with the eExam system interface and processes; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>organised practice sessions (PS) for students to &nbsp;familiarise themselves
with the eExam system interface and features.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This article shares the latest development in SEAB’s push towards modernising
education assessments for the N(A)-Level Social Studies, N(T)-Level Science,
and N(T)-Level Basic Mother Tongue Languages.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>N(A)-Level Social Studies</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The GCE N(A)-Level Social Studies paper transited to a hybrid mode of
e-Examinations in 2024. Candidates received the question paper in hard
copy and typed their responses via laptops on a Digital Answer Booklet
(DAB), which resided on SEAB’s eExam system. It was the first GCE Humanities
subject to be examined using this mode in Singapore as well as the first
e-Written examination to accommodate a large cohort of nearly ten thousand
candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Key features of Digital Answer Booklet (DAB)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DAB comes with the typical text editing tools such as bold, italic,
underline, copy and paste that most of us are familiar with doing word
processing. This aligns with our key objective to provide authentic and
relevant assessment experience that mirror the workplace through e-Examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Another useful feature is the bookmarking function, which allows candidates
to tag specific responses they wish to revisit before submission. These
bookmarked responses are highlighted during the review phase an is a personalisation
feature that makes it easy for candidates to quickly recall and refine
their responses.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Feedback from Candidates</strong>
</p>
<p>The feedback gathered from candidates highlighted a generally positive
experience with the e-Examination mode. Candidates found the eExam system
user-friendly and expressed confidence in using the system, particularly
when engaging with the Digital Answer Booklet (DAB). They found the DAB
functions helpful, contributing to a smooth and comfortable examination
experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to the PS, resources such as an information deck and a video
guide on the e-Examination interface were also made available on SEAB’s
website&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/e-exam-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SEAB - e-Exam Resources for School Candidates</a>),
which allowed students to revisit them as and when needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feedback from Social Studies teachers</strong>
</p>
<p>Interviews were also conducted with the Social Studies teachers, and they
provided positive feedback. Some of the comments include:</p>

<h4><strong>N(T)-Level Science&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The first-ever Science electronic examination took place in Singapore
on 13 September 2024 for 3,749 students offering the revised N(T)-Level
Science. &nbsp;This e-Examination for Paper 1 incorporated questions with
media-rich interactive stimuli such as videos, animations and interactive
simulations (VAI), which provide students with dynamic visual representations
of complex concepts. This media integration in the e-Examination supports
modern educational trends, creating a more immersive and exciting testing
experience. It caters to different learning styles (e.g., visual and kinesthetic),
and promotes critical thinking by encouraging active engagement with the
stimuli.</p>
<p>For example, one question in the 2024 e-Examinations featured a drag-and-drop
response format, designed to assess students' understanding of energy concepts.
This interactive format allowed students to manipulate different visual
elements within a virtual environment, giving them an alternative approach
to process and demonstrate their understanding.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Another question utilised an animation depicting the treatment of heart
patients with plaque in the arteries. The animation features a realistic,
step-by-step visualisation of a complex medical procedure and offers an
immersive learning experience that appeals to both visual and kinesthetic
learners.</p>

<p><em>A question in the 2024 e-Examination based on an animation involving the human heart.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, another question featured a video on electrical circuits,
where candidates observed the use of a multimeter to measure current flow
and analyse the behaviour of circuit components.&nbsp; The interactive
nature of the video, paired with questions that require candidates to analyse
the setup and apply their knowledge, encourages active problem-solving
and critical thinking.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p>The feedback from stakeholders was positive with many expressing that
the e-mode and VAI-embedded questions make Science assessments more engaging
and authentic.</p>
<p>The post-practice feedback from the students was highly favourable. For
example, 90% of about 2,300 respondents liked the experience of taking
the examination using a computer. Notably, 88% preferred to take the examination
on a computer rather than on paper. The experience during the PS also impacted
their views, with around 92% reporting that they looked forward to taking
other examinations on a computer. Encouragingly, observational reports
from schools showed that most students with approved Access Arrangements
found the functionalities of the eExam system intuitive and were able to
navigate its interface with ease.</p>

item formats, interested readers can refer to a previously published article

<h4><strong>N(T)-Level Basic Mother Tongue language&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Following the successful implementation and scaling up of e-Written examinations
for several Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) subjects, the N(T)-Level Basic
MTL (BMTL) Papers 1 and 2 were examined electronically with effect from
2024.</p>
<p>The interface of the BMTL Paper 1 e-Exam system is designed to be user-friendly
and efficient, with several key features to enhance the examination experience.
The word count feature helps candidates keep track of their responses,
ensuring they meet the required length. A countdown timer is prominently
displayed, allowing students to manage their time effectively throughout
the examination. Editing functions enable easy modifications to answers,
while the scroll-down icon ensures smooth navigation between sections.
Additionally, the "Review" feature allows candidates to revisit and modify
previously answered questions before submitting, offering greater flexibility
and control during the examination. These features work together to create
an intuitive and streamlined examination process.</p>

<p>During the PS, it was discovered that students taking Basic Tamil Language
needed more time and effort to adapt to the Tamil keyboard.&nbsp; Similarly,
students taking Basic Chinese Language needed more practices to enhance
their accuracy in typing Chinese characters using Hanyu Pinyin.</p>
<p>On the day of the examination, several officers from the Assessment Planning
and Development Division visited schools to observe the first e-Examination
for BMTL candidates firsthand.&nbsp; Candidates generally navigated the
eExam system interface with ease, requiring no assistance from invigilators.</p>

<p>The successful implementation of the e-Examinations for the N(A)-Level
Social Studies, N(T)-Level Science, and N(T)-Level Basic Mother Tongue
Languages in 2024 reinforces SEAB’s continued dedication to assessment
excellence. As with other subjects already assessed electronically, the
positive responses from the educators and students highlighted the eExam
system's user-friendliness, and the engaging, authentic nature of the assessment
experience. SEAB will continue to design assessments that are relevant
and effective in meeting the education goals of Singapore.</p>
