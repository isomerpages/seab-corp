<p>Since the introduction of e-Examinations in 2013, digital assessments
have been integrated into classrooms to align students’ learning with the
evolving needs of the modern workforce. In response to digitalisation and
technological advancements, Singapore’s e-Examinations offer a relevant,
authentic, and engaging assessment experience. By mirroring real-world
environments, such as computer text input, and using interactive media,
e-Examinations assess skills and knowledge that traditional pen-and-paper
methods cannot. In 2024, three subjects were assessed electronically, with
new assessment modes - N(A) Social Studies, N(T) Science, and N(T) Mother
Tongue Languages. This article shares how SEAB has continued in its push
towards modernising education assessments. &nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>N(A)-Level Social Studies</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The GCE N(A)-Level Social Studies paper transited to a hybrid mode of
e-Examinations in 2024. This marks the first GCE-Level Humanities subject
to be examined using this mode in Singapore as well as the first e-Written
examination to accommodate a large cohort of nearly ten thousand candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>N(T)-Level Science e-Examination&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The first-ever Science electronic examination took place in Singapore
on 13 September 2024 for 3,749 students offering the revised N(T)-Level
Science.&nbsp; This e-Examination for Paper 1 incorporated questions with
media-rich interactive stimuli such as videos, animations and interactive
simulations (VAI). The table provides a brief overview of the differences
between the previous and revised examination syllabuses (ES).&nbsp; For
detailed information on the assessment scheme and the electronic item formats,
interested readers can refer to a previously published article <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/publiccommunications/seab-link-newsletter/seab-link_issue-1_2022_final.pdf" class="Hyperlink SCXW240429030 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>N(T)-Level Basic Mother Tongue language&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Following the successful implementation and scaling up of e-Written examinations
for several Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) subjects, the N(T)-Level Basic
MTL (BMTL) Papers 1 and 2 were examined electronically with effect from
2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aligned to the latest syllabuses taught in schools, the revised examination
format was implemented for N(T) BMTL. Paper 1 required candidates to respond
to an online post through text input, while Paper 2 consisted of 15 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs). Candidates were required to submit their responses to
the questions via SEAB’s e-Examination system.</p>
