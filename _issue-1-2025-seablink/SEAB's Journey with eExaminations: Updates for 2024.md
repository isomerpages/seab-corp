<p>Since the introduction of e-Examinations in 2013, digital assessments
have been integrated into classrooms to align students’ learning with the
evolving needs of the modern workforce. In response to digitalisation and
technological advancements, Singapore’s e-Examinations offer a relevant,
authentic, and engaging assessment experience. By mirroring real-world
environments, such as computer text input, and using interactive media,
e-Examinations assess skills and knowledge that traditional pen-and-paper
methods cannot. In 2024, three subjects were assessed electronically, with
new assessment modes - N(A) Social Studies, N(T) Science, and N(T) Mother
Tongue Languages. This article shares how SEAB has continued in its push
towards modernising education assessments. &nbsp;</p>
