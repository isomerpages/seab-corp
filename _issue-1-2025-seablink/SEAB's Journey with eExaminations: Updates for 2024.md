<p>Digital assessments have been integrated into classrooms to align students’
learning with the evolving needs of the modern workforce. In response to
digitalisation and technological advancements, e-Examinations was introduced
in 2013 to offer a relevant, authentic, and engaging assessment experience.
By mirroring real-world environments, such as writing email responses,
and understanding information via interactive media, e-Examinations assess
skills and knowledge that traditional pen-and-paper methods cannot. In
2024, three subjects were assessed electronically, with the introduction
of new examination formats to assess students more effectively using technology.
These included N(A) Social Studies, N(T) Science, and N(T) Mother Tongue
Languages. This article shares how SEAB has continued in its push towards
modernising education assessments. &nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>N(A)-Level Social Studies</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The GCE N(A)-Level Social Studies paper transited to a hybrid mode of
e-Examinations in 2024. This marks the first GCE-Level Humanities subject
to be examined using this mode in Singapore as well as the first e-Written
examination to accommodate a large cohort of nearly ten thousand candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>What does a hybrid e-Examinations mode mean?&nbsp;</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Candidates receive the question paper in hard copy and type their responses
via laptops on a Digital Answer Booklet, which resides on SEAB’s eExam
system.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Key features of Digital Answer Booklet (DAB)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DAB comes with the typical text editing tools such as bold, italic,
underline, copy and paste that most of us are familiar with. This reiterates
one key objective of the e-Examinations, which is to provide an authentic
and relevant assessment experience that mirrors the workplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Another useful feature is the bookmarking function, which allows candidates
to tag specific responses they wish to revisit before submission. These
bookmarked responses are highlighted during the review phase, making it
easy for candidates to quickly recall and refine their responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hands-on practice sessions</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the examination, SEAB conducted practice sessions (PS) for students
from 22 to 25 April 2024. The objective of the PS was to familiarise students
with accessing the eExam system, as well as the interface and features
of the DAB. During the PS, SEAB staff visited several schools to observe
the sessions and provide technical support to the school personnel and
students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The survey conducted at the end of the PS (see Table 1) indicated that
students welcomed the e-Examination mode. They found the eExam system easy
to use, and they had a positive user experience when using the DAB. Students
felt comfortable and confident sitting for their GCE N(A)-Level Social
Studies e-Examination using the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the PS, resources such as an information deck and a video
guide on the e-Examination interface were made available on SEAB’s website&nbsp;

which allowed students to revisit them as and when needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Social Studies teachers’ feedback from PS and examination day</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted with the Social Studies teachers at the PS and
on the examination day, and they provided positive feedback. Some of the
teachers’ comments include:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Candidates’ experiences in the actual examinations</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post-examination conversations with candidates reflected positive experiences
as well. They preferred the electronic examination experience to the pen-based
examination and found the functions in the DAB helpful.&nbsp; Here are
some positive comments from candidates:&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>N(T)-Level Science&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The first-ever Science electronic examination took place in Singapore
on 13 September 2024 for 3,749 students offering the revised N(T)-Level
Science.&nbsp; This e-Examination for Paper 1 incorporated questions with
media-rich interactive stimuli such as videos, animations and interactive
simulations (VAI). The table provides a brief overview of the differences
between the previous and revised examination syllabuses (ES).&nbsp; For
detailed information on the assessment scheme and the electronic item formats,
interested readers can refer to a previously published article here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The journey to implementing the N(T)-Level Science e-Examination began
as early as 2017. To assess its feasibility, SEAB conducted studies in
20 secondary schools with students offering N(T)-Level Science.&nbsp; In
addition, SEAB held consultations with approximately 80 school leaders,
key personnel, and teachers from 34 other schools through various platforms
such as focus groups and school visits. The feedback from stakeholders
was positive with many expressing that the e-mode and VAI-embedded questions
make Science assessments more engaging and authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In preparation for the changes to the examination, SEAB held training
workshops and briefings for teachers and provided media resources to schools.&nbsp;
Students also had an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the e-Examination
system interface through practice sessions (PS) conducted in April 2024.&nbsp;
The post-practice feedback from the students was highly favourable. For
example, 90% of about 2,300 respondents liked the experience of taking
the examination using a computer. Notably, 88% preferred to take the exam
on a computer rather than on paper. The experience during the PS also impacted
their views with around 92% reporting that they looked forward to taking
other exams on a computer. Encouragingly, observational reports from schools
showed that most students with approved access arrangements found the functionalities
of the eExam system intuitive and could navigate its interface with ease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following photographs display snippets of the PS and some questions
from the actual 2024 e-Examination. We hope you find them interesting!&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>N(T)-Level Basic Mother Tongue language&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Following the successful implementation and scaling up of e-Written examinations
for several Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) subjects, the N(T)-Level Basic
MTL (BMTL) Papers 1 and 2 were examined electronically with effect from
2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aligned to the latest syllabuses taught in schools, the revised examination
format was implemented for N(T) BMTL. Paper 1 required candidates to respond
to an online post through text input, while Paper 2 consisted of 15 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs). Candidates were required to submit their responses to
the questions via SEAB’s e-Examination system.</p>
