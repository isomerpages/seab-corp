<p>SEAB has made considerable strides in 2025, expanding our local assessment
responsibilities across multiple subjects and levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three major developments demonstrate our commitment to taking greater
ownership of Singapore's examination processes while enhancing professional
development opportunities for our educators. These initiatives also lay
the groundwork for the implementation of the upcoming Secondary Education
Certificate (SEC) examinations in 2027, where G1, G2 and G3 subjects are
conducted within a common window. Sharing the marking load with Cambridge
would enable the SEC results to be processed in time for results release.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>N(A)-Level Mathematics Papers 1 and 2&nbsp;</h4>

<p>SEAB took over the marking of the N(A)-level Mathematics examinations,
further developing local assessment expertise in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over five days in October 2025, 107 dedicated teachers participated as
markers for Papers 1 and 2, supported by a curriculum specialist from MOE’s
Curriculum Planning and Development Division and a Master Teacher from
the Academy of Singapore Teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teachers showed enthusiasm from the start, engaging in thoughtful discussions
throughout the marking exercise. They valued the professional development
opportunity, particularly the chance to examine student responses firsthand
and observe how various approaches to problems were recognised and accepted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most teachers expressed interest in returning next year, establishing
a strong foundation for future Mathematics assessments.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>N(T)-Level Computer Applications Practical&nbsp;</h4>

<p></p>
<p>Simultaneously, we have successfully transitioned the marking of N(T)-Level
Computer Applications (CPA) Practical Paper 3 locally. Paper 3 requires
candidates to demonstrate diverse digital skills through video creation,
spreadsheet editing, and programming-based game creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a comprehensive training in August 2025, the marking team comprising
31 markers, 2 team leaders, and 1 Chief Examiner completed the five-day
marking exercise in November. The feedback received was predominantly positive,
with markers rating their experience highly on both satisfaction (3.6 out
of 4 on ‘I am happy with the marking experience’) and professional growth
(3.9 out of 4 on “Taking part in the marking exercise helps in my professional
growth”).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pertinent feedback included:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The marking of exercise was well-executed, level of support during the
marking was also very high. We could seek help for any questions on the
spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Team leads were helpful in clarifying doubts in the mark scheme. Fellow
CPA colleagues were also helpful in clarifying doubts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Arabic Language Examinations&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>

<p>The other milestone in 2025 was the complete ownership of test development,
marking, and grading for the O-Level Arabic and AO-Level Arabic examinations,
transitioning these responsibilities with strong support from MUIS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The planning of the transition began in 2021 and involved extensive discussions
with MUIS senior management in 2024, representing our commitment to serving
Singapore's diverse educational community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These three developments reflect SEAB's evolving role in Singapore's educational
landscape—taking greater local ownership while fostering professional growth
within our teaching community. Each initiative demonstrates how collaboration
between SEAB, educational institutions, and our dedicated educators creates
stronger, more responsive assessment systems that better serve our students
and maintain the high standards Singapore's education system is known for.&nbsp;</p>
