<p>At SEAB, fostering joy and community in the workplace is essential to
collective success and staff well-being. This edition highlights three
meaningful ways SEAB nurtures its vibrant workplace culture: the lively
Deepavali celebration that brought colleagues together across cultural
boundaries, heartwarming year-end festivities that celebrated achievements
and transitions, and thoughtful appreciation treats that provided sweet
respites during the busy examination season. These initiatives, both large
and small, demonstrate SEAB's commitment to creating a workplace where
staff feel valued, connected, and genuinely enjoy being part of the SEAB
family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Deepavali Joy at SEAB</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Deepavali celebration on 24 October 2025 at SEAB demonstrated how
festive occasions can strengthen workplace bonds and boost morale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Officers from different ethnic backgrounds came together to prepare traditional
festive foods, including pani puri, creating an authentic and inclusive
experience for all staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>An appetising display of Deepavali favourites greeted the staff</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides the delightful spread of traditional delicacies including curry
puffs, vadai, and freshly prepared teh tarik, what made this celebration
truly special was witnessing&nbsp; genuine joy and wide smiles across faces,
with everyone embracing the festive spirit by dressing in bright, bold
colours that transformed the workplace atmosphere during the busy period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Vibrant attire matching vibrant spirits during the Deepavali festivities.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two staff members stepped up to showcase their teh tarik pouring techniques
in an exciting ‘Teh Tarik Challenge’. Their performances drew enthusiastic
applause from supportive colleagues, creating an atmosphere of camaraderie
and shared enjoyment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Despite having no experience, the participants put their heart into the teh tarik challenge.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEAB management participated in the symbolic lighting of oil lamps. This
ceremonial lighting of oil lamps symbolised the leadership's dedication
to guiding SEAB towards continued organisational excellence. Just as the
traditional lamps dispel darkness, the collective efforts illuminate the
path forward for the organisation's success. This meaningful ceremony,
combined with educational segments about Deepavali traditions such as rangoli
art and the significance of muruku, helped deepen staff’s’ appreciation
for this important festival.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>SEAB management participated in the timeless tradition of lighting oil lamps</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highlight was undoubtedly the energetic Bhangra performance by the
Yaar-Panjaab Phangra (YPP) troupe, whose vibrant costumes and infectious
enthusiasm drew staff onto the stage to learn traditional dance moves.
This interactive element perfectly captured the spirit of Deepavali as
a celebration that brings people together across cultural boundaries.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Celebrating Joy and Season's Greetings: SEAB's Year-End Celebrations&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The festive spirit filled the air as SEAB staff gathered for the memorable
year-end "It's (Finally) Friday Season's Greetings" event on 28 November
2025. The celebration began with a delightful high tea featuring sweet
and savoury festive treats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his year-end speech, SEAB's Chief Executive, Mr Yue Lip Sin, summarised
the year through three meaningful themes: <strong>Purpose in our work, Joy at work, and Pride in our work</strong>.
His words resonated deeply, highlighting the passion and energy that all
SEAB staff bring to their roles each day, whilst reinforcing the shared
values and collective spirit that define SEAB's culture. He acknowledged
the dedication shown throughout the year, expressing gratitude for the
collective efforts that have driven SEAB's success and encouraged everyone
to carry this spirit forward into the new year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The occasion also marked an important moment of transition as SEAB bade
farewell to staff who had completed their secondments with SEAB and were
embarking on their next postings. SEAB extended heartfelt wishes for their
continued success and growth in their new roles. SEAB also thanked and
bade farewell to Mr Tan Kuo Cheang, former Director of Assessment Planning
and Development Division, for his leadership and significant contributions
to SEAB over the past three years. His guidance has left a lasting mark
on the organisation, and SEAB wished him the very best in his future endeavours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Energy soared as the celebration moved into a lively game of "Santa Says,
Stand Up If...” which got everyone on their feet and buzzing with excitement.
The enthusiasm continued to build with SEAB's inaugural inter-level Christmas
tree decoration competition held in the office. SEAB staff from different
divisions and levels showcased their creative Christmas tree decorations,
with representatives taking to the stage to champion their masterpieces.
The winning Christmas tree was decided based on voting. The friendly rivalry
brought out the best in everyone's competitive spirit whilst fostering
camaraderie across levels!&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the games and competition, the crowd settled down for a heartwarming
video presentation featuring heartfelt reflections from colleagues as they
shared their highlights, achievements, and memorable moments from 2025.
To cap off the celebration, a lucky draw with a twist ensured all staff
walked away as winners. This drew much excitement from everyone as they
eagerly drew out their lucky numbers in anticipation of their prizes.&nbsp;</p>

it was clear that this celebration achieved exactly what it set out to
do: closing 2025 on a high note filled with joy, gratitude, and togetherness.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Weathering through the exam season with sweet treats (bubble tea, ice cream)</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To celebrate the successful completion of some of the major examinations
for the year, SEAB’s Human Resource department organised a series of delightful
appreciation treats to thank staff. First up was a bubble tea treat which
took place on 2 October 2025, a day after the end of the Primary School
Leaving Examination (PSLE) Higher Mother Tongue Language exam. The mini
celebratory event was attended by approximately 160 staff, and they got
to choose from refreshing lychee jasmine tea or delicious earl grey milk
tea. Subsequently, on 11 November 2025, a day after the end of the GCE
O-Level Science examination, staff also got to enjoy an ice-cream treat
where they could choose from 11 exciting flavours!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Staff queuing up eagerly for their choice of bubble tea and ice cream treats</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These mini treats provided everyone with a well-deserved short break from
their work, while creating an opportunity for staff from different divisions
and departments to connect as they enjoyed the sweet treats. A big thank
you to all staff for all the commitment and hard work once again!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
