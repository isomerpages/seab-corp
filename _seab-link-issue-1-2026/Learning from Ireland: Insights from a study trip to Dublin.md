<p>In November 2025, Mr Yue Lip Sin, Chief Executive of SEAB and Ms Haslinda
Zamani, Divisional Director of Curriculum Planning and Development (CPDD)
led a delegation from SEAB, CPDD, and Student Development Curriculum Division
of MOE on a study trip to Dublin, Ireland to examine Ireland's education
system and recent reforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The timing was particularly apt, given Ireland's exceptional performance
in the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), where
it ranked second globally in reading, whilst also outperforming Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) averages in Mathematics
and Science.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Ireland’s education system</strong>
<br>Ireland operates an 8-3-2 education structure: eight years of primary
education (including Junior and Senior Infant levels), followed by three
years of Junior cycle and two years of Senior cycle, culminating in the
Leaving Certificate examination. The delegation engaged with key Irish
education officials, including the Chief Inspector from the Department
of Education and Youth, and Directors from the National Council of Curriculum
and Assessment and Educational Research Centre Ireland.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Recent educational reforms in Ireland</strong>
<br>The Irish curriculum reforms, currently in early implementation, centre
on preparing students for an increasingly complex world. Rather than emphasising
rote learning, the system prioritises developing critical thinking, problem-solving,
and self-assessment skills. Subjects like Climate Action &amp; Sustainable
Development exemplify this approach through interdisciplinary, solutions-focused
projects that encourage students to understand knowledge interconnectedness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A standout feature is the optional Transition Year Programme, embraced
by 75% of students. Schools enjoy autonomy in crafting unique curricula
aligned with their communities' needs, creating examination-free environments
that foster personal growth. Students engage in senior cycle taster modules,
work experience placements, and document their learning through portfolios.</p>

<p><strong>Balanced assessment approaches</strong>
<br>Ireland's assessment reforms are equally noteworthy. The Junior Cycle
Profile of Achievement incorporates classroom-based assessments alongside
state examinations, with teachers using externally provided guidelines.
The upcoming Senior Cycle reform (2025-2029) will introduce additional
assessment components worth at least 40% of total marks. Comprising portfolios,
projects, and oral assessments, they are designed to assess a wider range
of skills whilst reducing reliance on high-stakes written examinations.</p>
<p><strong>An affirmation of Singapore's direction</strong>
<br>The study trip validated many of Singapore's curriculum initiatives, particularly
in well-being, values education, and 21st-century competencies development.
Ireland's integration of key competencies like metacognition into its curriculum
affirms Singapore's commitment to developing these skills through its comprehensive
curriculum approach.</p>
<p>This exchange underscores the value of international collaboration in
education, providing insights that can inform Singapore's continued curriculum
evolution.&nbsp;</p>
