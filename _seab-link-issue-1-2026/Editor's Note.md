<p>Dear Readers,&nbsp;</p>
<p>From all of us in SEAB, cheers to a fresh start in 2026! This opening
issue reflects both our notable progress in 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking back, 2025 brought significant milestones and meaningful connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implementation of electronic examinations for N(A)-Level Mother Tongue
Languages marks another leap in our e-Examinations journey. Building on
successful Personal Learning Device (PLD) implementation for GCE N(T)-Level
e-Exams, with positive results from pilot schools Crest Secondary and Spectra
Secondary, we look forward to expanding PLD use in e-Examinations with
more schools in 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recognition of SEAB as Partner of the Academy of Singapore Teachers
underscores the collaborative spirit defining our work. This spirit extends
to our workplace culture, where we prioritise staff well-being through
meaningful celebrations and thoughtful gestures during busy seasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our study trip to Ireland provided invaluable insights for Singapore's
well-being and values education, while corporate engagement sessions with
Cambridge delegates and MOE colleagues strengthened vital partnerships.
Our sharing at the MOE Research Forum demonstrated our commitment to contributing
research insights across the education community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's to a 2026 filled with continued innovation, meaningful partnerships,
and joy in serving Singapore's educational mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy reading this issue.&nbsp;</p>
