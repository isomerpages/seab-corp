<p>SEAB was invited to showcase our research projects at the annual MOE Research
Forum. Held on 21 October 2025 at the Academy of Singapore Teachers, the
MOE Research Forum 2025’s theme ‘Co-Creating the Future of Education’ witnessed
strong interest in SEAB's two presentations. Drawing packed audiences and
sparking lively discussions among educators and researchers, SEAB presented
the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) Science Task and the Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup> assessment
for learning tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 21CC Science Task explored how students can demonstrate scientific
thinking and problem-solving skills in authentic contexts, while Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup> focused
on enhancing English Language reading comprehension and learning strategies.
Both projects represent SEAB's commitment to developing assessment approaches
that not only measure student learning but also support the development
of essential 21st-century competencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>(From left to right) From SEAB, Dr Diana Ng, Senior Assessment Specialist (Sciences), Ms Gail Yap and Ms Rinhi Tan, Research Officers, shared how students demonstrated scientific thinking and problem-solving in meaningful contexts&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Dr Rajenthiran Sellan (left), Lead Assessment Specialist (Languages and Literature) and Dr Koh Poh Wee (right), Acting Senior Research Specialist, shared insights on the SEAB's Read2Learn</em><sup> </sup><em><sup>EL</sup> tool and its impact on students’ reading comprehension and learning strategies</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The enthusiastic audience response extended beyond mere attendance numbers.
The 21CC Science Task session generated particularly thought-provoking
questions from the audience who were eager to understand how this innovative
approach differs from traditional science laboratory experiments. Unlike
typical science tasks which provide step-by-step guidance, the assessment
adopts hands-on, open-ended challenges that require students to apply Science
knowledge, make decisions, adapt strategies, and generate solutions. Participants
were curious about whether this constitutes formative assessment and explored
the potential for collaborative learning through group or pair-based task
completion. These questions reflected the education community's recognition
that SEAB's research addresses real classroom needs and future-ready skills
that students require in an increasingly complex world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Positive audience response to SEAB's innovative research findings at the MOE Forum, including an exhibit presentation from Mr Timmy Ng, Research Officer.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The positive reception of SEAB’s research projects at the MOE Research
Forum 2025 signaled strong support from the education community and affirmed
SEAB's research direction and contribution to ministry-wide research goals.
As these projects continue to develop, they offer valuable insights into
how assessment can better serve both learning and teaching in Singapore's
evolving educational landscape.&nbsp;</p>
