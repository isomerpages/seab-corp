<p>Electronic examinations (e-Examinations) have been implemented in the
national examinations by SEAB since 2013. Students have been sitting for
these examinations using school-owned devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The N(T)-Level Science e-Examination leverages on rich multimedia like animations, simulations and videos.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) implemented
in 2021, secondary school students have been using their Personal Learning
Devices (PLDs) regularly in classroom learning and assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEAB initiated a pilot programme for the use of PLDs in national e-Examinations
in a two-stage phased approach over six years (2025-2030). The use of PLDs
for e-Examinations allows students to better focus on demonstrating their
knowledge and skills using a device that they are familiar with.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Students refer to a hardcopy question paper and type their responses on a Digital Answer Booklet (DAB) on their PLDs for the e-Examination component of the Social Studies subject.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Studies on Use of PLDs in Time-Based Assessments</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The use of students’ own electronic device in e-Examinations is a practice
already adopted by various established examination boards, such as New
Zealand, Australia and Finland. Research has shown no significant differences
in students’ test performances when different types of electronic devices
are used in a time-based assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2023, SEAB has conducted studies on the effect of students using
their own electronic devices in a testing environment. Involving close
to 2,600 students from more than 20 schools using different types of PLDs
- Chromebooks, iPads and Windows laptops, the study results corroborated
the research findings and confirmed that the types of devices used in time-based
assessments have no impact on students’ performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students and teachers have provided positive feedback about using their
PLDs in such assessments during the studies:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Feedback from students:</em>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is easy for me because I know how my PLD works&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I am very comfortable with my PLD as I have used it very often&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Feedback from teachers:</em>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My students are confident in using PLDs for e-Examinations&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I feel confident in managing e-Examinations using PLDs&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>&nbsp;<br><strong>Successful Implementation of e-Examinations Using PLDs</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Students from Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School were
the first to use their PLDs in the 2025 national e-Examinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the examinations, students from both schools were guided on the
preparation of their devices and underwent practice sessions to familiarise
themselves with using their PLDs for national examinations. Teachers from
the schools also attended briefings and demonstration sessions conducted
by SEAB.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September 2025, 354 students from both schools sat for N(T)-Level English,
Science and Mother Tongue Languages e-Examinations with their PLDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Students from Crest Secondary (top) and Spectra Secondary (bottom) demonstrated positive engagement during the practice sessions, effectively utilising their PLDs in preparation for the e-Examinations.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feedback from the teachers and students in the two schools were positive.
Overall, close to 90% of students reported that they were comfortable using
their PLDs for national e-Examinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the positive results from the 2025 examinations, SEAB looks forward
to working with more schools to journey on the use of students’ PLDs in
e-Examinations!&nbsp;</p>
