<p>SEAB's recognition stems from our contributions to teachers' professional
development through work attachments and enriching learning journey programmes.
SEAB had supported AST's Teacher Work Attachment Plus (TWA+) Programme,
which aims to provide teachers with immersive short-term work attachment
experiences that have proven invaluable to their professional growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning as a learning journey in 2024, this became a cornerstone of
SEAB’s yearly engagement with educators from 2025 onwards, enhanced with
more comprehensive programme elements to deepen stakeholder engagement.
Participants have provided positive feedback about these experiences, highlighting
how they offered valuable insights about SEAB’s work and mission. These
sessions have demystified SEAB’s processes, fostering greater understanding
of our work in the education landscape.

professional growth of our teachers. We are encouraged to expand our efforts
in supporting professional growth across the education sector.&nbsp;</p>
