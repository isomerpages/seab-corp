<p>November 2025 marked a significant period of engagement for SEAB, as we
welcomed both international and local partners to deepen collaborative
relationships and share insights into Singapore's assessment landscape.
These visits served as vital opportunities for building bridges through
knowledge exchange, exemplifying SEAB's commitment to fostering meaningful
partnerships that enhance examination standards and support educational
excellence.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>SEAB welcomes Cambridge delegation</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>On 5 to 7 November 2025, SEAB hosted a delegation from Cambridge, comprising
Mr Jonathan Griffiths, Principal Assessment Advisor (Singapore), International
Education, Mr Simon Plummer, Senior Ministry Partnership Manager, and Mr
Darren Skates, Project Manager.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The three-day visit provided Cambridge delegates with comprehensive insights
into SEAB's examination processes and digital systems. The delegation received
detailed demonstrations of SEAB's question paper authoring system and coursework
management platform, which handles digital submissions from schools through
to assessment and moderation stages. One of the demonstrations included
how physical coursework could be digitised for Cambridge's marking processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cambridge team observed SEAB's complete scripts handling workflow,
from receiving papers from schools to scanning operations, and engaged
in discussions about potential process improvements. They also visited
Hwa Chong Institution to witness a live e-Examination in progress, gaining
on-the-ground perspective of how digital examinations are conducted in
schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other highlights included a tour of SEAB's Heritage Gallery, showcasing
the longstanding partnership between Singapore and Cambridge, and demonstrations
of the eMarking system and live marking exercises using the Onscreen Marking
(OSM) platform. The delegation also participated in discussions on Singapore-Cambridge
Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) implementation, syllabus development,
and other assessment matters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The visit strengthened the ongoing partnership between SEAB and Cambridge,
providing both parties with opportunities to enhance their collaborative
efforts in examination and assessment services.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>SEAB welcomes MOE colleagues for learning visits</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>SEAB was pleased to host MOE colleagues across two engagement visits in
November 2025. The sessions were part of our ongoing efforts to build stronger
partnerships with schools and enhance understanding of SEAB’s operations
and innovations. The first visit on 17 November 2025 was led by Zonal Directors
from Schools Division, Mr Andrew Lim (South Zone) and Ms Theodora Tan (West
Zone). The group comprised Cluster Superintendents and Special Assistants
from the North, South, and West Zones. On 21 November 2025, SEAB welcomed
a second group comprising School Leaders from the East Zone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visitors were first taken on an engaging tour of SEAB’s Heritage Gallery,
followed by a series of presentations and demonstrations about SEAB’s work,
from the intricate processes of onscreen marking to a deeper understanding
of e-Examinations and adaptive testing tools. Visitors from the North,
South and West Zones also gained valuable insights into Social Studies
assessment through a rare opportunity to observe live onscreen marking
sessions and interact with markers.</p>

<p>The visits offered opportunities for MOE colleagues to gain a deeper appreciation
of the systems, processes and innovations that enable SEAB to uphold examination
integrity and assessment quality at the national level. The sessions also
provided valuable space for open dialogue, sparking meaningful conversations
about evolving assessment needs, and how schools and SEAB can work together
to shape the future of assessment. MOE colleagues also recognised SEAB
for the professional conduct of examinations, operational and administrative
efficiency, and continuous support provided to schools, while always keeping
the students’ and teachers’ well-being in mind.</p>
<p>SEAB looks forward to continuing these engagements and fostering closer
partnerships with MOE as we collectively support student assessment and
national education goals.</p>
