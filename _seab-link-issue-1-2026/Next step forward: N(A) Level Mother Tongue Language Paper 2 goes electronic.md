<p>September 2025 marked another milestone in SEAB’s e-Examination journey,
as over 6,000 students sat for the N(A)-Level Mother Tongue Languages (MTL)
Paper 2 electronically. Paper 2 is a 90-minute examination which assess
students on their MTL language use and comprehension.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This transition did not happen overnight. Behind the scenes, dedicated
SEAB officers laid the groundwork through extensive preparation, which
included a comprehensive field test conducted in 2023 involving close to
330 students across nine schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of change management, students participated in hands-on practice
sessions in April 2025, giving them the opportunity to explore the new
digital interface and build confidence with the system before the actual
examination day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The e-Examinations were accessible to students as they generally adapted
well to the electronic format of exams.&nbsp; The text editing functions
helped students to organise their answers more efficiently and provide
more complete responses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This milestone represents more than just a technological upgrade—it's
a testament to SEAB’s commitment to evolving our assessment to prepare
our students for the future workplace, while preserving the rich heritage
of our Mother Tongue Languages.&nbsp;</p>
