<p>The Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS) is for international
students seeking admissions to Primary 2 to 5 and Secondary 1 to 3 in the&nbsp;following&nbsp;academic
year. MOE has commissioned SEAB to conduct the registration and test administration
of this exercise.</p>
<p>The AEIS registration period can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/international-students/aeis/apply" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>MOE's website</u></a>.
<br>The AEIS registration may close early if all the seats are filled.</p>

<p><strong>Important information for overseas applicants</strong> 
<br>MOE will not issue permits for entry into Singapore for applicants to
sit for the AEIS tests. The applicant should only submit his/her registration
if he/she is able to enter Singapore. Applicants should refer to the&nbsp;
<a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA)</u> 
</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp; <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ministry of Health (MOH)</u></a>&nbsp;websites
for the latest travel and health measures.
<br>
<br>An entry proof is issued after an approval is granted to the applicant
by MOE. The entry proof is needed for admission into the test venue for
the test-takers and for accompanying adults to identify themselves as the
parents/ guardians of primary-level students. It is not an entry permit
to Singapore.</p>
