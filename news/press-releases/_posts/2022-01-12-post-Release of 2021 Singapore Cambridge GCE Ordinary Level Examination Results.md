of Education Ordinary Level (GCE O-Level) Examination collected their results
from their secondary schools today<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>2. Arrangements have been made for school candidates to receive their
results in their respective classrooms. Only school candidates collecting
their results were allowed entry into the school premises, with Safe Management
Measures (SMMs) in place. Private candidates will be notified of their
individual result by post as per previous years. All candidates are also
able to access their results online via the Singapore Examinations and
Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates Portal at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a>.</p>
<p>3. A total of 23,555 candidates sat for the 2021 GCE O-Level Examination.

(96.4%) and 20,152 (85.6%) of the candidates have 3 or more and 5 or more

will receive Form A via post sent to the address that they had provided
