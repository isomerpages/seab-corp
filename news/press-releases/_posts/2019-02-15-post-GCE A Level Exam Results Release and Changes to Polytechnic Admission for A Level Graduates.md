<p>1. The results of the 2018 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of
Education Advanced Level (GCE A-Level) examination will be released on
Friday, 22 February 2019. School candidates may collect their results from
their respective schools from 2.30pm that day.</p>
<p>2. Private candidates will be notified of their results by post. The result
slips will be mailed on 22 February 2019 to the postal address provided
by the candidates during the registration period. Private candidates who
have SingPass<sup>1</sup> accounts can also use their SingPass to obtain
their results online, via the internet Examination Results Release System
(iERRS) on the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s website (
<a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u>
</a>) from 2.30pm on 22 February 2019.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Changes to Polytechnic Admissions for A-Level graduates</em></strong></h4>
<p>3. From Academic Year (AY) 2019, A-Level graduates who are looking to
further their studies at the polytechnics can look forward to obtaining
a diploma within a shortened timeline for a greater number of courses.
Currently, most A-Level graduates apply for and enroll&nbsp;in a polytechnic
only one year after getting their GCE A-Level examination results. This
is because most polytechnic admissions exercises would have closed by the
time students receive their A-Level results.</p>
<p>4. Changes are at hand – eligible A-Level graduates can now be exempted
from one semester of polytechnic studies and be admitted directly to Year
1 Semester 2 each October for 110 courses, up from the current nine. With
this, they reduce their polytechnic course from 3 years to 2.5 years. The
110 courses make up about half the diploma courses offered by the five
polytechnics, and span several course clusters.</p>
<p>5. With the one-semester exemption and entry into Year 1 Semester 2, A-Level
graduates who are not enlisting in National Service will be able to enter
the polytechnics in the same year that they receive their A-Level results.
As a result, this group will be able to graduate one year earlier. An illustration
of the shortened timeline is available in <u>Annex A</u>.</p>
<p>6. Interested A-Level graduates will be able to apply to the polytechnics
directly for these 110 courses in mid-August 2019, for matriculation at
the start of AY2019 Semester 2 in October 2019. More details will be available
on the respective polytechnics’ websites by March 2019.</p>
<p><sub>1 Private candidates can visit the SingPass website at www.singpass.gov.sg to find out if they are eligible for SingPass and to activate their SingPass Two-Factor Authentication if they have not done so.</sub>

<p><strong>Annex B</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON CHANGES TO POLYTECHNIC ADMISSIONS FOR A-LEVEL GRADUATES</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>How many A-Level graduates are admitted to the polytechnics each year? What is the typical profile of these students?</strong>
<br>
<br>About 200 A-Level graduates are admitted to the polytechnics each year.</p>
<p>
<br>These are students who are keen to pursue an applied pathway at the polytechnics,
that matches their area of interest/ aptitude. It includes both A-level
graduates who have applied and those who did not apply to the local Autonomous
Universities.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Currently, how and when do A-level students apply for admission into the polytechnics?</strong>
<br>
<br>Currently, A-Level graduates who are keen to enrol in the polytechnics
can apply via the Joint Admissions Exercise, which takes place in January,
using their O-Level results. They can also apply via the respective polytechnics’
Direct Admissions Exercise, which runs from December to March. For both
of these exercises, admission is at the start of Year 1 Semester 1, in
April.</p>
<p>With the changes, eligible A-Level graduates can now be exempted from
one semester of polytechnic studies and be admitted directly to Year 1
Semester 2 in October. This means they can apply for admission and enter
the polytechnic in the same year that they receive their A-Level results.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What are the requirements for A-Level graduates to receive module exemptions in the identified courses?</strong>
</p>
<p>For most courses, A-Level graduates would need passes in two relevant
H2 subjects to receive module exemptions. These requirements may differ
for specific courses, and details will be made available on the respective
polytechnics's websites.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How were the courses offering module exemption identified?</strong>
</p>
<p>Courses offering module exemption have sufficient commonalities between
the A-Level and polytechnic course curriculum. The exemptions are mostly
for polytechnic foundational modules. Exemptions from these modules would
not compromise A-Level graduates’ learning outcomes in the polytechnic
as students would have covered similar curriculum in preparing for the
A-Levels.</p>
<p>For example, A-Level graduates in Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Diploma in Information
Technology may be exempted from the modules on ‘Computing Mathematics’
and ‘Programming 1’ if they have obtained passes in H2 Computing or Computing
Science, and H2 Mathematics.</p>
<p>Similarly, A-Level graduates in Temasek Polytechnic’s Common Engineering
Programme may be exempted from the modules on ‘Engineering Mathematics
1’, ‘Engineering Physics’, ‘Digital Fundamentals 1’ and ‘Circuit Analysis’
if they have obtained passes in H2 Mathematics and H2 Physics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Will additional places be set aside in the polytechnics to cater to this group of A-Level graduates? How many places would be set aside?</strong>
</p>
<p>Places for A-Level graduates will be separately catered for. There will
be no impact on places available for O-Level graduates or ITE graduates.
The number of places for A- Level graduates will depend on the demand from
and quality of applicants, and hence will vary from year to year.</p>
