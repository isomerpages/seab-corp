<p>3. Besides school candidates, 1,570 private candidates also sat for the
2017 examination. 90.8% of them have been awarded certificates.</p>
<p>4. For the first batch of Normal (Academic) students who were offered
higher-level subjects under Subject-Based Banding (Secondary), about 370
took one or more subjects in English Language, Mathematics, Combined Sciences
and Mother Tongue Languages at the Express Level. These students’ overall
performance in these subjects were comparable to their peers in the O-Level
cohort.</p>
<p><strong>Joint Admissions Exercise</strong>
</p>
<p>5. Students who wish to apply for admission to Junior Colleges (JCs),
Millennia Institute, polytechnics, or the Institute of Technical Education
(ITE) may do so via the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) using their GCE
O-Level examination results. JAE registration will open from 3.00pm on
Friday, 12 January 2018 to 4.00pm on Wednesday, 17 January 2018.</p>
<p>6. Four JCs will not be admitting JC1 students in 2018<sup>1</sup>. The
other JCs will be able to increase their intake of students in the 2018
JAE. This may result in increases in cut-off points (COP) for JCs participating
in the 2018 JAE. These COP variations do not reflect the quality of each
JC nor its programmes. We encourage students to continue choosing JCs based
on each school’s distinctive programmes, CCAs, and school culture – factors
that can further develop their strengths and interests. We also want to
reassure students and parents that there will be sufficient capacity and
JC places to cater to demand.</p>
<p><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>
</p>
<p>7. Students who need guidance on educational options and next steps can
approach their teachers or the ECG Counsellors supporting their schools.
Alternatively, students can book an appointment to see an ECG Counsellor
at the MOE ECG Centre @ Grange Road from 8 to 19 Jan 2018, by calling the
ECG hotline at 6831 1420 or by logging on to <a href="mailto:MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg</u></a>.</p>
<p>8. In addition, students may wish to refer to the interactive web-based
MySkillsFuture portal. The one-stop portal provides up-to-date information
on the education options and career development pathways available to students
and points them to a range of suitable education and career possibilities.
Students may also use the portal to match their interests and aptitudes
to specific courses and careers.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> As announced in April 2017, four pairs of JCs will be merged
in 2019. Serangoon Junior College, Tampines Junior College, Jurong Junior
College and Innova Junior College will not be admitting JC1 students in
2018 and hence will not participate in the 2018 JAE. The programmes offered
at the merged site will be a combination of those previously offered at
the pair of merging JCs. More information is available in the 2018 JAE
Information Booklet.</p>
