<p>1. Students who sat for the 2017 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate
of Education (GCE) Normal (Academic) [N(A)] and Normal (Technical) [N(T)]
Level Examinations collected their results from their secondary schools
today<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>2. 9,983 students from the Secondary 4 N(A) Course and 4,793 students
from the Secondary 4 N(T) Course sat for the examinations.</p>
<p>3. 99.4% of the students from the N(A) course have been awarded the GCE
N(A)-Level certificate. The GCE N(A)-Level certificate is awarded to candidates
who obtain a pass grade (i.e. of Grade 5 or better) in at least one N(A)
subject.</p>
<p>4. 96.6% of the students from the N(T) course have been awarded the GCE
N(T)-Level certificate. The GCE N(T)-Level certificate is awarded to candidates
who obtain a pass grade (i.e. of Grade D or better) in at least one N(T)

<p><strong>PROGRESSION TO SECONDARY 5 NORMAL (ACADEMIC)</strong>
</p>
<p>5. 76.6% of the students from the N(A) course are eligible for promotion
to Secondary 5 N(A) in 2018. These are students in the N(A) course who
obtained an aggregate score not exceeding 19 points in English Language,
Mathematics and best three subjects (ELMAB3), and at least a Grade 5 for
all subjects used in the computation of the ELMAB3.</p>
<p>6. This year, 38.1% of students from the N(A) course sat for subjects
in the GCE Ordinary Level (GCE O-Level) Examinations. Using their combined
GCE N(A)-Level and school-based O-Level preliminary examination results,
these students are also eligible for promotion to Secondary 5 N(A) if they
obtain an aggregate score not exceeding 19 points in ELMAB3, and at least
a Grade 5 for all subjects used in the computation of the ELMAB3.</p>
<p><strong>PROGRESSION PATHWAYS FOR NORMAL (ACADEMIC) STUDENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>7. Firstly, Secondary 4 N(A) students who had sat for the GCE N(A)-Level
Examinations in 2017 and obtained an ELMAB3 aggregate of not exceeding
19 points<sup>2</sup> will have the option of applying for the Direct-Entry
Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP).</p>
<p>8. The DPP prepares Secondary 4 N(A) students for progression into selected
polytechnic diploma courses via a two-year <em>Higher Nitec</em> programme
at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Under the DPP, students
who successfully complete their <em>Higher Nitec</em> course and attain the
minimum qualifying Grade Point Average (GPA) are guaranteed a place in
a polytechnic diploma course mapped to their <em>Higher Nitec</em> course.</p>
<p>9. About 1,200 DPP places will be offered across all three ITE Colleges.
Applications for the DPP will open on 18 December 2017. For more information,
please refer to http://www.ite.edu.sg/wps/portal/definitely-des/.</p>
<p>10. Secondly, Secondary 4 N(A) students who sat for the GCE N(A)-Level
Examinations in 2017 and obtained an ELMAB3 aggregate not exceeding 11
points<sup>3</sup> will also have the option of applying for the Polytechnic
Foundation Programme (PFP).</p>
<p>11. The PFP is a one-year foundation programme at the polytechnics that
offers a practice-oriented curriculum taught by polytechnic lecturers,
to prepare students for entry into the relevant polytechnic diploma courses.
Upon completion of the PFP, students will progress to their pre-selected
diploma course, subject to them passing all modules in the PFP.</p>
<p>12. The polytechnics will offer about 1,200 PFP places in total. Applications
for the PFP will open in January 2018, after the release of the GCE O-Level
Examination results. Secondary 4 N(A) students who intend to apply for
the PFP should first progress to Secondary 5 on 2 January 2018. For more
information, please refer to <a href="https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/index.html</a>.</p>
<p><strong>PROGRESSION OF NORMAL (TECHNICAL) STUDENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>13. All N(T) course students who completed their secondary education in
2017 may apply to further their studies at ITE. Schools may also laterally
transfer Secondary 4 N(T) students to Secondary 4 N(A) if they have obtained
grade A for both English Language and Mathematics and grade B or better
for one other subject at the GCE N(T)-Level Examination.</p>
