<p>1. Candidates who sat for the 2021 Primary School Leaving Examination
(PSLE) under the new Achievement Level (AL) scoring system received their
results today. School candidates received their results in their respective
primary schools from 11am onwards while those who were unwell, self-isolating
due to COVID-19, or who preferred an alternative to gathering physically
in school, were also able to view their results online via Singapore Examinations
and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates Portal at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a>.</p>
<p>2. This is the first year where each PSLE subject has been scored using
eight ALs. The new PSLE scoring system aims to reduce fine differentiation
of students’ examination results at a young age, recognise students’ level
of achievement regardless of how their peers have performed, and allow
students and their parents to explore a wider range of secondary schools.</p>
<p><strong>Performance of 2021 Primary 6 Cohort</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Eligibility for Secondary School and Course Eligibility</u></strong>
</p>
<p>3. The course eligibility of the 2021 Primary 6 cohort is largely comparable
to that of the 2020 Primary 6 cohort under the T-score system. A total
of 39,119 Primary 6 candidates sat for the PSLE this year, of which 98.4%
are assessed suitable for secondary school courses. 68.4% of the candidates
are assessed suitable for the Express course, 18.9% for the Normal (Academic)
[N(A) course] and 11.1% for the Normal (Technical) [N(T)] course.</p>
<p>4. For the remaining candidates, they may choose to re-attempt the PSLE
next year. Alternatively, Assumption Pathway School (APS) and NorthLight
School (NLS) offer customised programmes with a more experiential and hands-on
learning approach, which can benefit these students. Students who have
attempted the PSLE once and would like to apply to APS or NLS can do so
with a recommendation from their primary school principal.</p>
<p><strong><u>Eligibility for Subject-Based Banding (Secondary) [SBB (Sec)]</u></strong>
</p>
<p>5. In 2018, the Ministry of Education (MOE) introduced Subject-Based Banding
(SBB) in all secondary schools with N(A) and N(T) courses to provide students
with greater flexibility to take various subjects at a more demanding level
based on their subject-specific strengths and aptitudes.</p>
<p>6. Under the AL scoring system, students in the N(A) and N(T) courses
will continue to be able to take subjects at a more demanding level from
Secondary 1 (S1), based on their AL scores for individual subjects<sup>1</sup>.
About 65% of students from the Normal courses are assessed to be suitable
to take at least one subject at a more demanding level. This is an increase
from 47% of students from the Normal courses in the 2021 S1 cohort, due
to the change in SBB (Sec) eligibility criteria under the AL system.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 1 (S1) Posting Exercise</strong>
</p>
<p>7. The S1 Option Form to select secondary schools will be given to eligible
students when they collect their PSLE results slips in person. Alternatively,
students can download a copy of the S1 Option Form from the Secondary 1
Internet System (S1-IS). The unique S1 Personal Identification Number (S1
PIN) to access the S1-IS had been given to students through their schools
at the end of Term 4.</p>
<p>8. The S1 Option Form provides key information regarding the submission
of school choices. Students, in discussion with their parents, should first
consider their secondary school choices, make their decision, and complete
the option form before logging on to the S1-IS to submit their secondary
school options. This will help to ensure the smooth completion of their
online submission. The S1-IS will be accessible from 11.30am on Wednesday,
24 November 2021 to 3.00pm on Tuesday, 30 November 2021 through MOE’s S1
Posting website at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</u></a>.</p>
<p>9. The indicative PSLE Score ranges for individual secondary schools released
by MOE in April 2021<sup>2</sup> serves as a starting point for students
and their parents as they consider their secondary school choices. However,
beyond grades, there are other important factors when considering what
would be a good fit for the student’s overall learning needs, strengths
and interests. These include the schools’ distinctive programmes, subjects
and Co-Curricular Activities offered, ethos and culture, home- school distance,
and support for Special Educational Needs, if required. For a more holistic
understanding of the offerings by the 139 secondary schools taking part
in the 2021 S1 Posting Exercise, please visit SchoolFinder (<a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder</u></a>).
Parents and students are encouraged to take the time to explore the schools’
websites, social media pages, as well as take part in their virtual open
houses, to find out more about the schools that interest them before selecting
the schools.</p>
<p><strong>Release of S1 Posting Results</strong>
</p>
<p>10. The S1 Posting Results will be released between 22 December 2021 and
24 December 2021. The posting results can be accessed through any of the
following channels:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Short Message Service (SMS) via a local mobile number (if provided by
the applicant during the application process)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S1-IS (<a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</u></a>)
using the student’s Birth Certificate number / FIN, and the S1 PIN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the student’s primary school</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>11. Students do not need to report to their posted secondary schools after
receiving their S1 Posting Results. Instead, they should refer to their
posted schools’ websites after receiving their posting results for more
information such as instructions on online purchase of books and uniforms,
booklist, and the reporting details. Parents of the incoming S1 cohort
who are on Parents Gateway (PG) would also receive instructions from the
posted schools from the afternoon of the day the S1 Posting results are
released.</p>
<p>12. If students are unable to report to their posted secondary school
on the first day of school in January 2022 due to valid reasons, they may
contact their posted secondary school directly to confirm that they are
taking up the place, and the school will reserve the place for them.</p>
