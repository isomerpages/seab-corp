<p><strong>Affected candidates have been given valid and fair assessment</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) has been informed
by Cambridge Assessment that a parcel containing 238 scripts for the 2017
GCE A-Level H2 Chemistry’s Paper 3 was stolen from a courier in the United
Kingdom (UK). The parcel was stolen while in transit from Cambridge Assessment
to the Examiner.</p>
<p>2. The parcel contained scripts from four Junior Colleges – Anderson JC
(58 scripts), Anglo-Chinese JC (60 scripts), Hwa Chong Institution (60
scripts) and Nanyang JC (60 scripts). This comprised about 3% of the 8,843
school candidates who sat for the 2017 GCE A-Level H2 Chemistry examination.</p>
<p>3. The theft occurred on 16 November 2017, and the courier company lodged
a report with the UK Police on the same day. To date, the case remains
under UK police investigation and the scripts have not been recovered.</p>
<p>4. Chief Executive of SEAB, Ms Tan Lay Choo, said, “SEAB has been working
closely with Cambridge Assessment to ensure a valid and fair assessment
of the affected candidates. Cambridge Assessment has asked SEAB to convey
its sincere apologies to the affected candidates for this regrettable incident,
and has given its assurance that it would review its processes to prevent
a recurrence.“</p>
<p><strong>Valid and Fair Assessment of Affected Candidates</strong>
</p>
<p>5. In such circumstances where a candidate does not have a mark for a
paper, Cambridge Assessment and SEAB have an established procedure to provide
affected candidates with a valid and fair assessment.</p>
<p>6. For this incident, Cambridge Assessment and SEAB took into consideration
the candidates’ performance in the other three Chemistry papers<sup>1</sup>,
which make up 65% of the final grade, and the cohort’s performance in the
subject. To check for consistency in the affected candidates’ overall performance
in the Chemistry subject, Cambridge Assessment and SEAB also took into
consideration the candidates’ school-based examination results.</p>
<p>7. Following this procedure, all 238 candidates obtained at least a pass
grade, with 81% scoring As and Bs for H2 Chemistry. All candidates attained
better grades or maintained their grades in the national examinations compared
to their school- based examinations.</p>
<p>8. Marking of the rest of the Chemistry exam scripts was not completed
until end January, after which Cambridge Assessment and SEAB worked to
award the grades of the affected candidates. Informing the affected candidates
of the theft incident earlier, without the awarded grades ready, would
have caused them undue anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Offer of Re-examination</strong>
</p>
<p>9. Cambridge Assessment and SEAB will offer affected candidates the option
of a re-examination of the H2 Chemistry Paper 3 on 25 April 2018. The results
of the re-examination will be released by mid-May 2018.</p>
<p>10. In addition, candidates in full-time national service have the option
of taking the re-examination of the H2 Chemistry Paper 3 in November 2018
instead of 25 April 2018. The results of the re-examination will be released
by February 2019.</p>
<p>11. Candidates can only register for one re-examination - either April
or November 2018 and must register their choice by 9 March 2018. Details
of the registration have been provided by SEAB to the candidates.</p>
<p>12. The re-examination of H2 Chemistry Paper 3 will be based on the same
curriculum that the candidates had been taught in schools. The re-examination
of Paper 3 will be pegged at the same standard as the 2017 GCE A-Level
H2 Chemistry Paper 3 examination. The examination format will also remain
unchanged.</p>
<p>13. For candidates who wish to take up the re-examination, Cambridge Assessment
and SEAB will give the better of the two grades, i.e. the better of the
awarded grade and the re-examination grade, will be recorded in their GCE
A-Level result slip and certificate. For the other candidates who do not
wish to take the re- examination, their awarded grade will be recorded
as the final grade in the GCE A- Level result slip and certificate.</p>
<p>14. For students who opt for the re-examination, SEAB will work with the
local Autonomous Universities to consider their re-examination results,
for the purpose of shortlisting for interviews, as well as final course
admissions or scholarship applications.</p>
<p>15. SEAB has taken the necessary actions to ensure that the affected candidates
are not disadvantaged and are given a valid and fair assessment. Ms Tan
Lay Choo added, “We understand the concerns that the affected candidates
may have. SEAB and schools are in contact with them and their parents and
will continue to provide them with the necessary support.</p>
