<p>1. Students collected their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)
results from their respective primary schools today.</p>
<p><strong><u>Performance of 2019 Primary 6 Cohort</u></strong>
</p>
<p>2. A total of 40,256 Primary 6 students sat for the PSLE this year<sup>1</sup>.
39,622 students (or 98.4%) are assessed suitable to progress to secondary
school. 66.3% are eligible for the Express course, 21.0% for the Normal
(Academic) course, and 11.2% for the Normal (Technical) course.</p>
<p>3. 634 students (or 1.6%) did not qualify for any of the Express, Normal
(Academic) or Normal (Technical) courses. These students may choose to
re-attempt the PSLE in the coming year (2020). Alternatively, they can
apply to Assumption Pathway School (APS) or NorthLight School (NLS) for
a more experiential and hands-on learning approach. Students who have attempted
the PSLE once and would like to apply to APS or NLS can do so with a recommendation
from their primary school principal.</p>
<p><strong><u>2019 Secondary 1 (S1) Posting Exercise</u></strong>
</p>
<p>4. Eligible students would have also received the S1 option forms to select
secondary schools when they collected their results slips. In every sealed
S1 Option Form, there will be a unique S1 Personal Identification Number
(S1 PIN) which can be used by students to submit their secondary school
choices online and to view the posting outcome subsequently via the Secondary
1 Internet System (S1-IS). The S1- IS will be accessible from 11.00am on
Thursday, 21 November 2019 to 3.00pm on Wednesday, 27 November 2019 at
<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</u>
</a>. Alternatively, the option form can be submitted through the studentâ€™s
primary school. Submission at primary schools can be made during the following
timeslots: 11.00am to 3.00pm on 21 November 2019, and 9.00am to 3.00pm
on 22 and 25-27 November 2019.</p>
<p>5. Students have a wide variety of quality secondary schools to choose
from. When choosing secondary schools, students - in discussion with their
parents - should consider schools with cultures, programmes and environments
best suited to their learning needs and interests (e.g. Applied Learning
Programmes, Learning for Life Programmes, Co-Curricular Activities).</p>
<p>6. The S1 posting results will be released on Friday, 20 December 2019.
Students will then need to report to the secondary schools that they are
posted to on Monday, 23 December 2019 at 8.30am.</p>
<p><strong><sub>1 This does not include children who are exempted from Compulsory Education (CE). This year, 14 out of 43 CE- exempt home-schooled children from the 2014 P1 cohort did not meet the PSLE benchmark. Home-schooled children who did not meet the benchmark must re-attempt the PSLE in 2020. Should they wish to attend a mainstream school to take full advantage of the teaching resources and programmes, MOE will facilitate their admission to a suitable primary school.</sub></strong>
