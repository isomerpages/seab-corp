<p>1. Candidates who sat for the 2022 Primary School Leaving Examination
(PSLE) received their results today. Arrangements were made for candidates
to receive their results in their respective primary schools or view their
results online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB)
Candidates Portal at <a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Performance of 2022 Primary 6 Cohort</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Eligibility for Secondary School and Course Eligibility</u></strong>
</p>
<p>2. The course eligibility of the 2022 Primary 6 cohort is comparable to
that of the 2021 Primary 6 cohort, who first took the PSLE under the Achievement
Level (AL) scoring system. A total of 37,095 Primary 6 candidates sat for
the PSLE this year, of which 98.4% are assessed suitable for secondary
school courses. 68.4% of the candidates are assessed suitable for the Express
course, 18.7% for the Normal (Academic) [N(A) course] and 11.3% for the
Normal (Technical) [N(T)] course.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;The remaining students may choose to re-attempt the PSLE next
year. Alternatively, Assumption Pathway School (APS) and NorthLight School
(NLS) offer customised programmes with a more experiential and hands-on
learning approach, which can benefit these students. Students who have
attempted the PSLE once and would like to apply to APS or NLS can do so
with a recommendation from their primary school principal.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility for Subject-Based Banding (Secondary) [SBB (Sec)]</strong>
</p>
<p>4. Under SBB (Sec), students in the N(A) and N(T) courses will be able
to take certain subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 1 (S1)<sup>1</sup> based
on their AL scores for individual PSLE subjects. For the 2022 Primary 6
cohort, about 62% of students from the N(A) and N(T) courses are assessed
to be suitable to take at least one subject at a more demanding level as
they progress to secondary school.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 1 (S1) Posting Exercise</strong>
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;The S1 Option Form to select secondary schools will be given to
eligible students together with their PSLE results. The S1 Option Form
provides key information regarding the submission of school choices.</p>
<p>6. A unique S1 Personal Identification Number (S1 PIN) to access the Secondary
1 Internet System (S1-IS) can be found on the top-right hand corner of
the S1 Option Form. Using the S1-IS, students can download a copy of the
S1 Option Form and submit their school choices online.</p>
<p>7. The S1-IS will be accessible from 11.30am on Wednesday, 23 November
2022 to 3.00pm on Tuesday, 29 November 2022 through MOE’s S1 Posting website
at <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/s1-posting/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</u></a>.
To ensure smooth completion of their online submission, students should
– in discussion with their parents – first consider their secondary school
choices, make their decision, and complete the option form before logging
on to the S1-IS.</p>
<p>8. When choosing a secondary school that would be a good fit for the student’s
overall educational needs, strengths and interests, students and parents
are encouraged to consider a holistic range of factors. This includes the
school’s distinctive programmes, subject offerings, Co-Curricular Activities
(CCAs), ethos, culture, location and support for Special Educational Needs,
if required.</p>
<p>9. For a more holistic understanding of the offerings by the 139 secondary
schools taking part in the 2022 S1 Posting Exercise, please visit SchoolFinder
(<a href="https://moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder</u></a>).
Parents and students are encouraged to take the time to explore the schools’
websites, social media pages, as well as take part in their open houses
( <a href="https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/open-house-for-secondary-schools-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/open-house-for-secondary-schools-2022</u></a> ),
to find out more about the schools that interest them before selecting
the schools.</p>
