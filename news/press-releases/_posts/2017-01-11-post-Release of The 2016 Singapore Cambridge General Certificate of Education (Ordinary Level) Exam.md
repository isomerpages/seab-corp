<p>4. Students should take into consideration their interests, abilities
and passion when exploring the various education pathways available after
their O-Level examination. They are encouraged to speak with their parents,
teachers, and ECG Counsellors for guidance in making an informed decision.</p>
<p>5. In addition, students may wish to refer to http://www.ecareers.sg,
an interactive web-based ECG portal hosted by the Ministry of Education.
The portal provides up-to-date information on the education options and
career development pathways available to students and points them to a
range of suitable education and career possibilities. Students may use
the portal to match their interests and aptitudes to courses and careers.</p>
<p>6. To complement the ECG programmes and services provided by schools,
students who do not yet have an ECG Counsellor in their schools may book
an appointment to see an ECG Counsellor at the ECG Centre@MOE (Grange Road)
to help them make informed education choices. Appointments can be made
via email: <a href="mailto:MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg</a> or
the ECG hotline at 6831 1420.</p>
