<p>The results of the 2024 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will
be released on Wednesday, 20 November 2024 at 11.00am. Arrangements have
been made for school candidates to receive their results from their respective
primary schools.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Details on the collection arrangements will be shared by the respective
schools with their students. School candidates who are unable to return
to school to collect their results may appoint a proxy to do so on their
behalf by Friday, 22 November 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Choosing Secondary Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Students are encouraged to consider schools holistically when choosing
a secondary school that would be a good fit for their educational needs,
strengths and interests. This includes considering factors such as school
culture, distinctive programmes, subject offerings, and Co-Curricular Activities.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Schools’ Cut-Off Points (COPs) from last year’s Secondary 1 (S1) Posting
Exercise only serve as a reference and may vary from year to year, depending
on the cohort’s PSLE results and school choices in the Secondary 1 (S1)
Posting Exercise. Students are encouraged to include at least 2 to 3 schools
within their 6 school choices with COPs that are less stringent than their
PSLE score. This will help increase their chances of securing a place in
one of their preferred schools. Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB),
which has been fully implemented in 120 secondary schools from this year’s
S1 cohort, will provide students greater customisation and flexibility
in their learning.</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Students can visit the schools’ open houses and explore their websites
to find out more about schools’ offerings. More information is available
at:</p>

<p><strong>Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Crest Secondary School (CSS) and Spectra Secondary School (SSS) offer an
alternative educational pathway for students eligible for Posting Group
1 only or the Posting Group 1/2 Option Band, and who are more inclined
towards practice-oriented, hands-on learning. The schools offer a customised
skills-based curriculum and exposure to unique learning opportunities,
putting students in good stead for progression to the Institute of Technical
Education (ITE). More information on CSS and SSS can be found on their
school websites (<a href="https://go.gov.sg/secschoolfinder" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.crestsec.edu.sg/</u></a> and
<a href="https://go.gov.sg/secschoolfinder" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.spectra.edu.sg/</u>
</a>). The schools also organise open houses, where students can find out
more about the schools’ distinctive programmes, subjects, culture, ethos,
and other offerings.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Eligible students interested to study in CSS or SSS can apply directly
by submitting their school application to CSS and SSS starting from 11.30am
on Wednesday, 20 November 2024 to 3.00pm on Tuesday, 26 November 2024.
Application forms for these two schools are available at students’ respective
primary schools, or on the school websites of CSS and SSS. <u>Students who have applied directly should continue to submit the S1 Option Form</u>,
to facilitate posting to another school of their choice if they are not
admitted to CSS or SSS. Students who applied directly to CSS or SSS and
are admitted will be informed of the outcome by Wednesday, 11 December
2024, and their other S1 school choices will be voided. Eligible students
who did not apply directly to CSS or SSS but wish to be considered for
admission to these schools may indicate CSS and SSS as one of their school
choices in the S1 Option Form.</p>
<p><strong>Submission of Secondary 1 School Choices and Options</strong>
</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The S1 Option Form to select secondary schools will be given to eligible
students together with their PSLE results. The S1 Option Form provides
key information regarding the submission of school choices.</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A unique S1 Personal Identification Number (S1 PIN) can be found on the
top-right hand corner of the S1 Option Form. Students should use the S1
PIN to log in to the Secondary 1 Internet System (S1-IS) and submit their
S1 school choices and options online after discussion with their parents.
The S1-IS will be accessible from 11.30am on Wednesday, 20 November 2024
to 3.00pm on Tuesday, 26 November 2024 through MOE’s S1 Posting website
at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/secschoolfinder" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</u></a>.</p>
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents who require
assistance with their online submission may contact the student’s primary
school before 3.00pm on Tuesday, 26 November 2024.</p>

<p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students do not
need to report to their posted secondary schools upon receiving their S1
Posting Results. Students should refer to their posted schools’ websites
after receiving their posting results for more information, such as the
reporting details, booklist, and purchase of books and uniforms. Parents
of the incoming S1 cohort who are on Parents Gateway (PG) will also receive
instructions from the posted schools from the afternoon the S1 Posting
results are released.</p>
<p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If students are
unable to report to their posted secondary school on the first day of school
in January 2025 due to valid reasons, they should inform their posted secondary
school directly after receiving their posting results to confirm that they
are taking up the place, and the school will be able to reserve the place
for them. More information on S1 Posting and S1-IS are available at MOE’s&nbsp;S1
Posting website. For enquiries, please visit <a href="https://go.gov.sg/secschoolfinder" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.moe.gov.sg/contact</u></a>.</p>
