<p>Students who sat for the 2025 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)
received their results today. Arrangements were made for students to receive
their results in their respective primary schools.</p>
<p><strong>Performance of 2025 Primary 6 Cohort</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Eligibility for Secondary School</u>
</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A total of 37,926 Primary
6 students sat for the PSLE this year, of which 98.5% are assessed suitable
for secondary school.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining students may
choose to re-attempt the PSLE next year. Alternatively, students may choose
to apply to Assumption Pathway School (APS) and NorthLight School (NLS)
which offer customised programmes with a more experiential and hands-on
learning approach. Those who have attempted the PSLE once can apply to
these schools with a recommendation from their primary school principal.</p>
<p><u>Eligibility for Subjects at a More Demanding Level</u>
</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Full Subject-Based
Banding (Full SBB), students who are eligible for Posting Groups 1 and
2 (offering most of their subjects at G1 and G2 respectively) may take
English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science subjects
at a more demanding level from Secondary 1 (S1) based on their Achievement
Level (AL) scores for the respective subject. Students who scored AL 5
or better for a PSLE Standard subject can take the subject at G3 or G2.
Students who scored AL 6 for a PSLE Standard subject or AL A for a PSLE
Foundation subject can take the subject at G2. For the 2025 Primary 6 cohort,
about 65% of students eligible for Posting Groups 1 and 2 can take at least
one subject at a more demanding level. This is comparable to the previous
year’s cohort. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More details on Full SBB and
the eligibility criteria to take subjects at a more demanding level can
be found at: <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/secondary-school-experience.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/secondary-school-experience.html</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>S1 Posting Exercise</strong>
</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The S1 Option
Form regarding submission of secondary school choices will be given to
all eligible students together with their PSLE results.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents can submit
their S1 school choices and options through the online S1 Portal which
is accessible through MOE’s S1 Posting website (<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</a>),
between 11.30am on 25 November 2025 and 4:30pm on 1 December 2025.</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents will require a valid
Singpass to log in to the S1 Portal. Only one parent is required to log
in and submit the registration through the S1 Portal. Parents who require
assistance with their online submission may contact the student’s primary
school before 4:30pm on 1 December 2025.</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students and parents
are encouraged to consider schools holistically when choosing a secondary
school that would be a good fit for the student’s educational needs, strengths
and interests. This includes the school’s distinctive programmes, subject
offerings, Co-Curricular Activities, ethos, culture, location and support
for Special Educational Needs, if required. Within their 6 school choices,
students are encouraged to include at least 2 to 3 schools whose previous
year’s Cut-Off Points (COPs) are less stringent than their PSLE score.
Students and parents are reminded that previous year’s school COPs are
for their reference only as they resulted from the previous year’s S1 Posting
Exercise. COPs can vary up to a few points from year to year, depending
on each cohort’s PSLE results and school choices. Including school choices
with less stringent COPs may help increase students’ chances of securing
a place in one of their chosen schools.</p>
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a more holistic understanding
of the offerings by the 141 secondary schools taking part in the 2025 S1
Posting Exercise, students and parents can visit SchoolFinder (<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder</a>).
Students and parents are encouraged to take the time to explore the schools’
websites, social media pages, as well as take part in their open houses
(<a href="https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/open-house-for-secondary-schools/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/open-house-for-secondary-schools/</a>),
to find out more about the schools that best suit and interest them before
submitting their school choices.</p>
