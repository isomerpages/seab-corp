<p>1. The results of the 2020 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of
Education Advanced Level (GCE A-Level) examination will be released on
Friday, 19 February 2021, 2.30pm.</p>
<p><strong>Results Release for School Candidates</strong>
</p>
<p>2. Given the COVID-19 situation, arrangements have been made for school
candidates to receive their results from their respective schools – in
their individual classrooms instead of gathering as a cohort – from 2.30pm
on 19 February 2021. Only school candidates collecting their results will
be allowed entry into the school premises, and they will be expected to
observe the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in place.</p>
<p>3. School candidates who are unwell, on Quarantine Order, Stay-Home Notice
or Leave of Absence on the day of the results release should not return
to school to collect their results. Instead, they may view their results
online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) results
release system at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a> from 3.15pm on
19 February 2021. The system will be accessible from 19 February 2021 to
5 March 2021.</p>
<p>4. School candidates who are eligible for SingPass<sup>1</sup> can use
their SingPass account to access SEAB’s online results release system.
School candidates who are International Students can access the results
release system using the SEAB-issued PIN sent to their email addresses
which their schools had provided to SEAB.</p>
<p>5. School candidates can also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy
of their results on their behalf. Proxies are required to collect the results
by Tuesday, 23 February 2021, and produce the relevant documents for the
school’s verification. School candidates may contact their schools for
assistance if they are unable to appoint a proxy, or if they have not received
their password for SEAB’s results release system.</p>
<p><strong>Results Release for Private Candidates</strong>
</p>
<p>6. Private candidates will be notified of their individual results by
post. The result slips will be mailed on 19 February 2021 to the address
that private candidates had provided to SEAB. Private candidates who are
eligible for SingPass can also use their SingPass account to obtain their
results online via SEAB’s online results release system, similar to the
arrangement for school candidates. Private candidates who are non-SingPass
holders can use the SEAB-issued PIN sent to their email addresses which
they had provided to SEAB.</p>
<p><strong>Applications to Autonomous Universities</strong>
</p>
<p>7. Students who wish to apply for admissions and/or scholarships to the
Autonomous Universities (AUs) are encouraged to submit their applications
online. All school candidates who apply to the AUs online do not need to
submit a hard copy of their A-Level certificates. More information on the
AUs’ admissions processes can be found on their respective websites, and
applicants can approach the AUs directly for further clarifications.</p>
<p><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>
</p>
<p>8. Students who would like guidance on their education options can approach
their teachers or the ECG Counsellors supporting their schools. Students
can also refer to the interactive MySkillsFuture portal at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/mysfpreu" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://go.gov.sg/mysfpreu</u></a> to
find out more about the education options, career pathways and courses
that are available to them.</p>
<p>9. To complement the ECG services provided by schools, students can make
an appointment for online or phone counselling with an ECG Counsellor from
the ECG Centre at MOE (Grange Road) via the e-Appointment system at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre</u></a>,
calling the ECG hotline at 6831 1420, or emailing <a href="MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg</u></a>. The MOE ECG Centre
will offer online or phone counselling from 15 February to 19 March 2021,
9.00am to 5.00pm (Saturdays: 9.00am to 12.30pm).</p>
