<p>1. Students who sat for the 2023 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)
received their results today. Arrangements were made for students to receive
their results in their respective primary schools.</p>
<p><strong>Performance of 2023 Primary 6 Cohort</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Eligibility for Secondary School</u>
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;A total of 38,088 Primary 6 students sat for the PSLE this year,
of which 98.4% are assessed suitable for secondary school.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;The remaining students may choose to re-attempt the PSLE next
year. Alternatively, Assumption Pathway School (APS) and NorthLight School
(NLS) offer customised programmes with a more experiential and hands-on
learning approach, which can benefit these students. Students who have
attempted the PSLE once and would like to apply to APS or NLS can do so
with a recommendation from their primary school principal.</p>
<p><u>Eligibility for Subjects at a More Demanding Level</u>
</p>
<p>4. Under Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB), students who are eligible
for Posting Groups 1 and 2 (offering most of their subjects at G1 or G2
respectively) may offer English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics,
and Science at a more demanding level from Secondary 1 (S1) based on their
Achievement Level (AL) scores for the respective subject. Students who
scored AL 5 or better for a PSLE Standard subject can take the subject
at G3 or G2 and students who scored at least AL 6 for a PSLE Standard subject
or AL A for a PSLE Foundation subject can take the subject at G2. For the
2023 Primary 6 cohort, about 64% of students eligible for Posting Groups
1 and 2 are suitable to take at least one subject at a more demanding level.
This is comparable to the previous year’s cohort eligible for the Normal
courses.</p>
<p>5. More details on Full SBB and the eligibility criteria to take subjects
at a more demanding level can be found at: <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/secondary-school-experience.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/secondary-school-experience.html</u></a>
</p>
<p><strong>S1 Posting Exercise</strong>
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;The S1 Option Form to select secondary schools will be given to
eligible students together with their PSLE results. The S1 Option Form
provides key information regarding the submission of school choices.</p>
<p>7. A unique S1 Personal Identification Number (S1 PIN) to access the S1
Internet System (S1-IS) can be found on the top-right hand corner of the
S1 Option Form. Using the S1-IS, students can download a copy of the S1
Option Form and submit their school choices online.</p>
<p>8. The S1-IS will be accessible from 11.30am on Wednesday, 22 November
2023 to 3.00pm on Tuesday, 28 November 2023 through MOE’s S1 Posting website
at <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/secondary-school-experience.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</u></a>.
To ensure smooth completion of their online submission, students should
– in discussion with their parents – first consider their secondary school
choices, make their decision, and complete the option form before logging
on to the S1-IS.</p>
<p>9. When choosing a secondary school that would be a good fit for the student’s
overall educational needs, strengths and interests, students and parents
are encouraged to consider a holistic range of factors. This includes the
school’s distinctive programmes, subject offerings, Co-Curricular Activities,
ethos, culture, location and support for Special Educational Needs, if
required.</p>
<p>10. For a more holistic understanding of the offerings by the 141 secondary
schools taking part in the 2023 S1 Posting Exercise, please visit SchoolFinder
(<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder</a>).
Parents and students are encouraged to take the time to explore the schools’
websites, social media pages, as well as take part in their open houses
