on the AUs’ admissions processes can be found on their respective websites,
and applicants can approach the AUs directly for further clarifications.</p>
<p><strong>Applications to Polytechnics</strong>

a polytechnic diploma by up to one year. Interested students should apply
directly to the polytechnics from 21 February to 6 March 2023, for matriculation
in April 2023. Students may also apply in August 2023 for matriculation
