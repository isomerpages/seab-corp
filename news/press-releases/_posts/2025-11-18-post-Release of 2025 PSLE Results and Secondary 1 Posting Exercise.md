<p>The results of the 2025 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will
be released on 25 November 2025 at 11.00am. Arrangements have been made
for school candidates to receive their results from their respective primary
schools.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of the
collection arrangements will be shared by the respective schools with their
students. School candidates who are unable to return to school to collect
their results may appoint a proxy to do so on their behalf by 27 November
2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Choosing Secondary Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are encouraged
to consider schools holistically when choosing a secondary school that
would be a good fit for their educational needs, strengths and interests.
This includes considering factors such as school culture, distinctive programmes,
subject offerings, and Co-Curricular Activities.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are also
encouraged to include at least 2 to 3 schools within their 6 school choices
with previous year’s Cut-Off Points (COPs) that are less stringent than
their PSLE score. Schools’ COPs from last year’s Secondary 1 (S1) Posting
Exercise only serve as a reference and COPs can vary up to a few points
from year to year, depending on the cohort’s PSLE results and school choices
in the S1 Posting Exercise. Including school choices with less stringent
COPs may increase students’ chances of securing a place in one of their
chosen schools. Full Subject-Based Banding, fully implemented in secondary
schools, will provide students greater customisation and flexibility in
their learning.</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students can visit
the schools’ open houses and explore their websites to find out more about
the schools’ offerings. More information is available at:</p>
