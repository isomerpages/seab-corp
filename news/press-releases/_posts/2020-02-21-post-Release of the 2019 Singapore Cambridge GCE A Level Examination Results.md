<p>1. Students who sat for the 2019 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate
of Education (GCE) Advanced Level (GCE A-Level) examination received their
results today<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>2. 12,405 candidates sat for the 2019 GCE A-Level examination. 11,583
(93.4%) of these candidates have attained at least 3 H2 passes, with a
pass in General Paper (GP) or Knowledge and Inquiry (KI). The performance
of candidates in this cohort is comparable to the performance of the 2018
cohort.</p>
<p><u>Digital Certificates and Applications to Autonomous Universities</u>
</p>
<p>3. Starting this year, all A-Level candidates who are Singapore Citizens
and Singapore Permanent Residents will receive digital certificates in
OpenCerts format. These certificates will be available via the MySkillsFuture
Skills Passport at https://www.myskillsfuture.sg/content/portal/en/individual/skills-passport.html
from Monday, 24 February 2020. Candidates with SingPass can access and
submit their digital certificates electronically to the universities they
are applying to. School candidates who are international students and unable
to access the portal may email SEAB at <a href="mailto:seab_gce_admin@seab.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">seab_gce_admin@seab.gov.sg</a> to
ask for a copy of their digital certificates.</p>
<p>4. Applications for admissions and/or scholarships to the Autonomous Universities
(AUs) can be done online. All school candidates who apply to the AUs online
do not need to submit a copy of their A-Level certificates. Due to the
COVID-19 situation, the AUs will make alternative arrangements for any
assessment for admissions, if applicants cannot be physically present.</p>
<p><u>Applications to Polytechnics</u>
</p>
<p>5. Eligible A-Level graduates who are looking to further their studies
at the polytechnics can benefit from module exemptions in 120 courses.
This will reduce the time taken for them to obtain a polytechnic diploma
by up to one year. Interested students can apply to the polytechnics via
their websites directly in mid-August 2020, for matriculation in October
2020. Application details will be made available on the respective polytechnics’
websites by March 2020.</p>
<p><u>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</u>
</p>
<p>6. Students who need guidance on their education options can approach
their teachers or the ECG Counsellors supporting their schools. Students
can also refer to the interactive MySkillsFuture portal at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/mysfpreu" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/mysfpreu</a> to
find out more about the education options, career pathways and courses
that are suited to their strengths, interests and abilities. Students may
also visit the websites of AUs and polytechnics to understand more about
the institutions’ offerings and their curricula, which cater to different
learning preferences.</p>
<p>7. Alternatively, students can contact the MOE ECG Centre @ Grange Road
from 14 to 28 February 2020 for ECG counselling via email: <a href="mailto:MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg</a> or
