<p>1. The results of the 2021 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will
be released on Wednesday, 24 November 2021. Arrangements have been made
for school candidates to receive their results from their respective primary
schools in their respective classrooms from 11 am on 24 November 2021,
with the necessary Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in place.</p>
<p>2. We recognise that having the opportunity to collect their examination
results in person is an important part of the educational journey, as it
gives students the opportunity to be with their classmates and consult
their teachers face-to-face on their next steps.</p>
<p>3. One parent/guardian can accompany their child/ward to school to collect
their PSLE results. To minimise congestion and intermingling, parents/guardians
will need to wait at the designated areas in the schools and also observe
the necessary SMMs, while their child/ward receives their results in the
classroom. Parents/guardians will not be allowed to access or wait near
the classrooms.</p>
<p>4. School candidates and parents issued the Ministry of Health’s Health
Risk Warning will be allowed to collect their results in person if they
test negative using the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) on the day of the results
release before going to school. School candidates who are unwell or self-isolating
due to a positive COVID-19 test result should not return to school to collect
their results. They have the option of accessing their results online<sup>1</sup> via
Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates Portal
at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a> from
11.45 am on 24 November 2021. School candidates would have received their
user account issued by SEAB through their schools from 15 November 2021.
The system will be accessible from 24 November 2021 to 7 December 2021.</p>
<p>5. School candidates can also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy
of their results on their behalf. Proxies are required to collect the results
by Friday, 26 November, and produce the relevant documents for the school’s
verification. If school candidates have not received their user account
for SEAB’s Candidates Portal, or are unable to appoint a proxy to collect
their results, they may contact their school for assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing Secondary Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>6. In April this year, the Ministry of Education (MOE) released the indicative
PSLE Score ranges for individual secondary schools<sup>2</sup> to guide
students and their parents in considering secondary school choices under
the Achievement Level (AL) scoring system. While indicative PSLE Score
ranges are a starting point when considering school choices, there are
other important factors when choosing schools that would be a good fit
for the student’s overall educational needs, strengths and interests. These
include the school’s distinctive programmes, subjects and Co-Curricular
Activities (CCAs) offerings, as well as the school’s ethos, culture, location
and support for Special Educational needs if required. The Primary Schools
will continue to provide Education and Career Guidance (ECG) support to
their students in making informed secondary school choices.</p>
<p>7. Students and their parents are encouraged to visit secondary schools’
open houses and explore the schools’ websites, and social media pages,
to better understand the schools’ environment, programmes and culture.
The following websites will provide more information:</p>

<p><strong>Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>8. Specialised Schools for Normal (Technical) students (SSNTs) – Crest
Secondary School (CSS) and Spectra Secondary School (SSS) – offer an alternative
educational pathway for students eligible for the Normal (Technical) course,
who have an interest in practice-oriented, hands-on learning. The schools
offer a customised skills-based curriculum and exposure to authentic learning
opportunities, putting students in good stead for progression to the Institute
of Technical Education (ITE). The SSNTs also provide a whole-school environment
that emphasises values, socio-emotional learning and character-building
- which in turn helps to nurture holistic and confident learners who are
ready to seize the opportunities of the future.</p>
<p>9. Students in the SSNTs will study GCE Normal (Technical)-Level English
Language, Mother Tongue Language and Mathematics. Selected students can
take Science as an additional subject. As part of Subject-Based Banding,
eligible students can also take selected subjects at Normal (Academic)-Level.
Secondary 3 students will also specialise in two of five skills subjects<sup>3</sup> offered
under the ITE Skills Subject Certificate (ISSC). The ISSC provides a more
broad-based curriculum that widens students’ exposure to different industry
growth areas, allowing students to better discover their interests and
make more informed choices about their post-secondary education and future
careers.</p>
<p>10. Students and their parents are encouraged to visit CSS and SSS’ school
websites (<a href="https://www.crestsec.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.crestsec.edu.sg</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.spectra.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.spectra.edu.sg</u>
</a>) for information on their Pre-Registration Experiences, where they can
register to visit the schools in small groups to find out more about the
schools’ distinctive programmes, subjects, culture, ethos and other offerings.
CSS’ e-Immersion games portal “Crest Adventure” (www.crestopenhouse.sg)
also offers a fun and engaging way for interested students to learn about
CSS’ unique curriculum. A video tour of SSS is also available on their
school website.</p>
<p>11. More information on CSS and SSS can be found on their school websites
and in page 3 of the “Choosing Your Secondary Schools” information booklet.
Interested and eligible students may submit their application during the
Pre-Registration Exercise at the respective schools from 24 November to
27 November 2021. Application forms for these two schools are available
at students’ respective primary schools, or online (<a href="https://www.crestsec.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.crestsec.edu.sg</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.spectra.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.spectra.edu.sg</u>
</a>). They may also submit their applications via email or directly to the
school’s Admin Office. The deadline for applications is 30 November 2021,
3.00pm. At the same time, these students should also indicate their choices
for other secondary schools under Secondary 1 (S1) Posting. This will ensure
that those who are not admitted into CSS or SSS can be posted to another
school of their choice in a timely and seamless manner.</p>
<p>12. Students successfully admitted into CSS or SSS will be informed by
the schools by 15 December 2021. Their S1 school choices will then be voided
and they will not be posted to other secondary schools.</p>
<p><strong>Submission of Secondary 1 Options</strong>
</p>
<p>13. The S1 Option Form to select secondary schools will be given to eligible
students when they collect their results slips in person. Alternatively,
students may download a copy of the S1 Option Form from the Secondary 1
Internet System (S1-IS) using the unique S1 Personal Identification Number
(S1 PIN) that was distributed to students through their primary schools
at the end of Term 4.</p>
<p>14. The S1 Option Form provides key information regarding the submission
of school choices. Students, in discussion with their parents, should first
consider their secondary school choices, make their decision, and complete
the option form before logging on to the S1-IS to submit their secondary
school options. The S1-IS will be accessible from 11.30am on Wednesday,
24 November 2021 to 3.00pm on Tuesday, 30 November 2021 through MOE’s S1
Posting website at <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/s1-posting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</u></a>.
Alternatively, parents may contact the student’s primary school and seek
their assistance to submit the S1 options before 3.00pm on Tuesday, 30
November 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Release of Secondary 1 Posting Results</strong>
</p>
<p>15. The S1 Posting Results will be released between 22 December 2021 and
24 December 2021. The posting results can be accessed through any of the
following channels:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Short Message Service (SMS) via a local mobile number (if provided by
the applicant during the application process);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S1-IS (<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/s1-posting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</u></a>)
using the student’s Birth Certificate number / FIN, and the S1 PIN; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the student’s primary school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>16. Students do not need to report to their posted secondary schools after
receiving their S1 Posting Results. Students should refer to their posted
schools’ websites after receiving their posting results for more information
such as instructions on online purchase of books and uniforms, booklist,
and the reporting details. Parents of the incoming S1 cohort who are on
Parents Gateway (PG) will also receive instructions from the posted schools
from the afternoon of the day the S1 Posting results are released.</p>
<p>17. If students are unable to report to their posted secondary school
on the first day of school in January 2022 due to valid reasons, they may
contact their posted secondary school directly after receiving their posting
results to confirm that they are taking up the place, and the school will
be able to reserve the place for them. More information on S1 Posting and
S1-IS are available at MOE’s S1 Posting website and in the information
booklet “Choosing Your Secondary Schools” distributed to Primary 6 students.
