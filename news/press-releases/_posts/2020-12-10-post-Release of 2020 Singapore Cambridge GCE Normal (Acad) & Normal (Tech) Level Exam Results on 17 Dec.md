<p><strong>Results Release for School Candidates</strong>
<br>2. Given the ongoing COVID-19 situation, arrangements have been made for
school candidates to receive their results from their respective secondary

as in previous years – from 2.00pm on 17 December 2020. Only school candidates
collecting their results will be allowed entry into the school premises,
and they will be expected to observe the Safe Management Measures (SMMs)
in place.</p>
<p>3. School candidates who are unwell, on Quarantine Order, Stay-Home Notice
or Leave of Absence on the day of the results release, should not return
to school to collect their results. Instead, they may view their results
online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) results
release system at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.seab.gov.sg</a> from 2.30pm on 17 December
2020. The system will be accessible from 17 to 31 December 2020.</p>

their SingPass account to access SEAB’s online results release system.
School candidates who are International Students can access the results
release system using the SEAB-issued PIN sent to their email addresses
which their schools had provided to SEAB.</p>
<p>5. School candidates can also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy
of their results on their behalf. School candidates may contact their schools
for assistance if they are unable to appoint a proxy, or if they have not
received their password for SEAB’s results release system.</p>
<p><strong>Results Release for Private Candidates</strong>
<br>6. Private candidates will be notified of their individual results by
post. The results will be mailed on 17 December 2020 to the address that
private candidates had provided to SEAB.</p>
<p>7. Private candidates who are eligible for SingPass can also use their
SingPass account to obtain their results online via SEAB’s online results
release system, similar to the arrangement for school candidates. Private
candidates who are non-SingPass holders can use the SEAB-issued PIN sent
to their email addresses which they had provided to SEAB.</p>
