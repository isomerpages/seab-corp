<p>1. The results of the 2023 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will
be released on Wednesday, 22 November 2023 at 11.00am. Arrangements have
been made for school candidates to receive their results from their respective
primary schools.
<br>
<br>2. Details on the collection arrangements will be shared by the respective
schools with their students. School candidates who are unable to return
to school to collect their results may appoint a proxy to do so on their
behalf by Friday, 24 November 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Choosing Secondary Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>3. Students are encouraged to consider schools holistically when choosing
a secondary school that would be a good fit for their educational needs,
strengths and interests. While schools’ PSLE Cut-Off Points from last year’s
Secondary 1 (S1) Posting Exercise can serve as a reference, students are
encouraged to also consider factors such as school culture, distinctive
programmes, subject offerings, and Co-Curricular Activities when making
their school choices. Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB), which will
be fully implemented in 120 secondary schools from the 2024 S1 cohort,
will provide students greater customisation and flexibility in their learning.</p>
<p>4. Students are encouraged to visit the schools’ open houses and explore
their websites. More information is available at:</p>

<p><strong>Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School </strong>
<br>
<br>5. Crest Secondary School (CSS) and Spectra Secondary School (SSS) offer
an alternative educational pathway for students eligible for Posting Group
1 only or the Posting Group 1/2 Option Band, and who are more inclined
towards practice-oriented, hands-on learning. The schools offer a customised
skills-based curriculum and exposure to unique learning opportunities,
putting students in good stead for progression to the Institute of Technical
Education (ITE). Both schools also provide a whole-school approach that
emphasises values, socio-emotional learning and character-building to nurture
holistic and confident learners. More information on CSS and SSS can be
found on their school websites (<a href="http://www.crestsec.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.crestsec.edu.sg</a> and <a href="http://www.spectra.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.spectra.edu.sg</a>).
The schools also organise open houses, where students can find out more
about the schools’ distinctive programmes, subjects, culture, ethos, and
other offerings.
<br>
<br>6. Eligible students interested to study in CSS or SSS can apply directly
by submitting their school application to CSS and SSS starting from 11.30am
on Wednesday, 22 November 2023 to 3.00pm on Tuesday, 28 November 2023.
Application forms for these two schools are available at students’ respective
primary schools, or on the school websites of CSS and SSS. <u>Students who have applied directly should continue to submit the S1 Option Form</u>,
to facilitate posting to another school of their choice if they are not
admitted to CSS or SSS. Students who applied directly to CSS or SSS and
are admitted will be informed of the outcome by Wednesday, 13 December
2023, and their other S1 school choices will be voided. For eligible students
who did not apply directly to CSS or SSS but wish to be considered for
admission to these schools, they may indicate CSS and SSS as one of their
school choices in the S1 Option Form.</p>
<p><strong>Submission of Secondary 1 School Choices and Options</strong>
</p>
<p>7. The S1 Option Form to select secondary schools will be given to eligible
students together with their PSLE results. The S1 Option Form provides
key information regarding the submission of school choices.
<br>
</p>
<p>8. A unique S1 Personal Identification Number (S1 PIN) can be found on
the top-right hand corner of the S1 Option Form. Students should use the
S1 PIN to log in to the Secondary 1 Internet System (S1-IS) and submit
their S1 school choices and options online. The S1-IS will be accessible
from 11.30am on Wednesday, 22 November 2023 to 3.00pm on Tuesday, 28 November
2023 through MOE’s S1 Posting website at <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</a>.</p>
<p>9. Students, in discussion with their parents, should first consider their
school choices and complete the S1 Option Form before logging on to the
S1-IS to submit their S1 school choices and options. This will help in
the smooth completion of their online submission. Parents who require assistance
with their online submission may contact the student’s primary school before
3.00pm on Tuesday, 28 November 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Release of Secondary 1 Posting Results</strong>
</p>
<p>10. The S1 Posting Results will be released between Wednesday, 20 December
2023 and Friday, 22 December 2023. The posting results can be accessed
through any of the following channels:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Short Message Service (SMS) via a local mobile number (if provided by
the applicant during the application process);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S1-IS (<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</a>)
using the student’s Birth Certificate number / FIN, and the S1 PIN; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the student’s primary school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>11. Students do not need to report to their posted secondary schools upon
receiving their S1 Posting Results. Students should refer to their posted
schools’ websites after receiving their posting results for more information,
such as the reporting details, booklist, and purchase of books and uniforms.
Parents of the incoming S1 cohort who are on Parents Gateway (PG) will
also receive instructions from the posted schools from the afternoon the
S1 Posting results are released.</p>
<p>12. If students are unable to report to their posted secondary school
on the first day of school in January 2024 due to valid reasons, they should
inform their posted secondary school directly after receiving their posting
results to confirm that they are taking up the place, and the school will
be able to reserve the place for them. More information on S1 Posting and
S1-IS are available at MOE’s&nbsp;S1 Posting website. For enquiries, please
