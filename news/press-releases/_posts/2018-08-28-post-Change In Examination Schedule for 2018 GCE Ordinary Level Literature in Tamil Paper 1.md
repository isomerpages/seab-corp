<p><strong>Examination rescheduled to Monday, 19 November 2018, 10.00am</strong>
</p>
<p>1. The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) has rescheduled
the 2018 GCE O-Level Literature in Tamil Paper 1 from Wednesday, 7 November
2018, 2.00pm, to <strong>Monday, 19 November 2018, 10.00am.</strong>
</p>
<p>2. The GCE O-Level examination is conducted within October and November
each year. In planning the timetable, SEAB is mindful about balancing the
number of papers that candidates have to sit within this time frame, while
minimising timetable clashes due to the variety of subject combinations
offered.</p>
<p>3. When there is a gazetted festive public holiday within the examination
period, SEAB will avoid scheduling examinations on the afternoon of the
eve of the festival and in the morning after the festival to minimise disruption
to the festive celebrations.</p>
<p>4. This year, Deepavali falls on 6 November, which is in the middle of
the examination schedule. SEAB received feedback about the GCE O-Level
Literature in Tamil Paper 1 taking place a day after Deepavali.</p>
<p>5. After careful deliberation, SEAB will be rescheduling the paper to <strong>19 November 2018 at 10.00am</strong>,
which is the last day of the GCE O-Level examination. As there are only
nine candidates taking this paper, the marking and results processing can
still be completed in time for the 2018 GCE O-Level examination results
release in January 2019.</p>
<p>6. There are no changes to the examination timetable for the other GCE
O-Level papers<sup>1</sup> scheduled on Wednesday, 7 November 2018. The
updated examination timetable can be accessed on SEAB’s website.</p>
<p><strong><sup><sub>1 </sub></sup><sub>GCE O-Level Islamic Religious Knowledge (2080) Paper 1; GCE O-Level Literature in Chinese (2093) Paper 1; GCE O- Level Literature in Malay (2238) Paper 1; GCE O-Level Burmese (3249) Paper 1; GCE O-Level Thai (3260) Paper 1</sub></strong>
