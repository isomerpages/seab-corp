<p>1. Since 1 June 2021, over 310,000 eligible students (around 90%) have
registered for their vaccination appointments and by this Sunday, 27 June
about 297,000 would have taken their first dose of the vaccination before
school reopens on 28 June<sup>1</sup>. The breakdown of student vaccination
rates can be found in Annex A.</p>
<p>2. As part of our continued efforts to safeguard the safety and well-being
of students and school staff, MOE and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment
Board (SEAB) will be putting in place a series of enhanced Safe Management
Measures (SMMs) for the 2021 national oral examinations.</p>
<p>3. In view of the more infectious variants of the COVID-19 virus, all
candidates and oral examiners will be required to wear surgical masks during
the upcoming PSLE and Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education
(GCE) oral examinations<sup>2</sup> to minimise the risk of transmission.</p>
<p>4. As facial expressions will not be taken into consideration for the
assessment, candidates will not be disadvantaged by the wearing of surgical
masks during oral examinations. The following processes will be in place
to ensure that oral examiners and candidates can hear each other clearly:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Before the start of the examination, oral examiners will ask each candidate
to state his/her name and school loudly, to ensure that they can hear each
other clearly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the examination, candidates can request for the oral examiners
to repeat their questions or speak louder. Likewise, oral examiners can
also request candidates to speak louder if they are unable to hear them
clearly. A placard will be placed in front of the candidate to remind them
that they can do so. Similar to current practice, candidates will not be
penalised for such requests. Oral examiners will also take the special
circumstance of mask wearing into consideration when assessing the candidates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Other SMMs will continue to be in place for this year’s oral examinations,
such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Temperature and symptom screening for entry into schools and examination
venues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staggered dismissal of candidates;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequent cleaning of high touch surfaces; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a well-ventilated venue such as hall or classrooms for the examinations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>6. Candidates will not be allowed to sit for the PSLE and GCE oral and
listening comprehension examinations<sup>3</sup> if they:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>have COVID-19,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are placed on Quarantine Order (QO) or Stay Home Notice,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are issued with Leave of Absence (LOA) due to close contact with confirmed
case or as a result of staying in same household with individuals on QO,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are on medical leave due to Acute Respiratory Infection, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are on Approved Absence, as a result of staying in same household with
members (aged 6 and above) who have flu-like symptoms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>7. As the oral examinations are conducted over several days, candidates
who miss the oral examinations on their assigned date with valid reasons
(e.g. vaccination appointment that was booked earlier) can take the examinations
on another date within the oral examination window or sit for the make-up
oral examination. The date of the make-up oral examination will be provided
to affected candidates. Candidates who miss the oral and listening comprehension
examinations with valid reasons, and are unable to sit for the oral examination
within the examination window or make-up oral examination, can apply for
special consideration<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>8. For the remaining papers for the 2021 national examinations, SMMs and
exam arrangements will remain similar to those implemented last year.</p>
<p><strong>Removal of Common Last Topics in PSLE 2021</strong>
</p>
<p>9. In 2020, Common Last Topics<sup>5</sup> (CLT) were removed from the
national examinations for graduating cohorts due to the impact of the extended
circuit breaker period on curriculum time and on teaching and learning.</p>
<p>10. Drawing on last year’s experience of 3.5-weeks of full Home-Based
Learning (HBL), schools were able to carry out 7 days of full HBL smoothly
from 19 to 28 May this year, and are expected to be able to cover the examinable
curriculum in good time for this year’s national examinations.</p>
<p>11. However, Primary 6 (P6) students may encounter additional disruptions
to their learning compared to other graduating cohorts as a significant
proportion of our P6 students are still not eligible for the COVID-19 vaccination
due to age. With the more infectious variants of the COVID-19 virus, the
need for occasional instances of full HBL in our primary schools, at the
localised level, cannot be ruled out. After careful consideration of these
factors, as well as the fact that younger P6 students may not learn as
effectively during HBL, MOE and SEAB will remove the CLT for the 2021 PSLE
(please refer to Annex B for the CLT to be removed). This move aims to
support the wellbeing of our P6 students, who also have to familiarise
themselves with the new PSLE Achievement Level scoring system.</p>
<p>12. The 2021 GCE-level examinations will not be affected as these considerations
apply to a significantly lesser extent for older students, with over 90%
expected to be fully vaccinated by August.</p>
<p><strong>Resumption of Co-Curricular Activities From 12 July</strong>
</p>
<p>13. MOE had earlier announced that students will progressively return
to schools from 28 June 2021<sup>6</sup> , with in-person Co-Curricular
Activities (CCA) gradually resuming from the second week of Term 3. In
line with the national posture on the evolving COVID-19 situation, in-person
CCA will now only resume from 12 July, the third week of Term 3, for secondary
schools, Junior Colleges/Millennia Institute, aligned with national guidelines,
to safeguard the wellbeing of students and staff. In-person CCA for primary
schools will resume in the fifth week of Term 3.</p>
<p>14. MOE and SEAB will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and provide
updates if there are further changes to the arrangements for this year’s
national examinations and school activities.</p>
<p><strong><sup><sub>1</sub></sup><sub> As of 22 June, 6pm.</sub></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><sup><sub>2</sub></sup><sub> For candidates who do not have surgical masks, provisions will be made at the examination venue.</sub></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><sup><sub>3</sub></sup><sub> The PSLE and GCE oral and listening comprehension examination schedule can be found on SEAB’s website at </sub><a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sub>https://www.seab.gov.sg</sub></a><sub>.</sub></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><sup><sub>4</sub></sup><sub> Special consideration is a well-established procedure which awards affected candidates with projected grades through an evidence-based and data-driven approach. SEAB will consider multiple sources of evidence, such as the candidate’s performance in the other papers for that affected subject in national and school-based examinations as well as the school cohort's performance in national and school- based exams, to ensure a fair assessment. All special consideration applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis and subjected to a rigorous review process.</sub></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><sup><sub>5</sub></sup><sub> Common Last Topics (CLT) are a set of topics MOE has identified from the relevant subject syllabus that would be taught last by all schools for the graduating cohorts. In the event of unforeseen circumstances impacting the completion of schools' teaching for the graduation cohorts, CLT can be removed from the scope covered in the national examinations.</sub></strong>
