<p>Students who sat for the 2024 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)
received their results today. Arrangements were made for students to receive
their results in their respective primary schools.</p>
<p><strong>Performance of 2024 Primary 6 Cohort</strong>
</p>
<p><u>Eligibility for Secondary School</u>
</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
total of 40,894 Primary 6 students sat for the PSLE this year, of which
98.5% are assessed suitable for secondary school.</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
remaining students may choose to re-attempt the PSLE next year. Alternatively,
Assumption Pathway School (APS) and NorthLight School (NLS) offer customised
programmes with a more experiential and hands-on learning approach, which
can benefit these students. Students who have attempted the PSLE once and
would like to apply to APS or NLS can do so with a recommendation from
their primary school principal.</p>
<p><u>Eligibility for Subjects at a More Demanding Level</u>
</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under
Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB), students who are eligible for Posting
Groups 1 and 2 (offering most of their subjects at G1 and G2 respectively)
may offer English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science
at a more demanding level from Secondary 1 (S1) based on their Achievement
Level (AL) scores for the respective subject. Students who scored AL 5
or better for a PSLE Standard subject can take the subject at G3 or G2
and students who scored at least AL 6 for a PSLE Standard subject or AL
A for a PSLE Foundation subject can take the subject at G2. For the 2024
Primary 6 cohort, about 65% of students eligible for Posting Groups 1 and
2 can take at least one subject at a more demanding level. This is comparable
to the previous year’s cohort.</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More
details on Full SBB and the eligibility criteria to take subjects at a
more demanding level can be found at: <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/secondary-school-experience.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/secondary-school-experience.html</a>.
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>S1 Posting Exercise</strong>
</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
S1 Option Form to select secondary schools will be given to eligible students
together with their PSLE results. The S1 Option Form provides key information
regarding the submission of school choices.</p>
<p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
unique S1 Personal Identification Number (S1 PIN) to access the S1 Internet
System (S1-IS) can be found on the top-right hand corner of the S1 Option
Form. Students should use the S1 PIN to log in to the S1-IS and submit
their S1 school choices and options online after discussion with their
parents.</p>
<p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
S1-IS will be accessible from 11.30am on Wednesday, 20 November 2024 to
3.00pm on Tuesday, 26 November 2024 through MOE’s S1 Posting website at
<a href="www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</a>.</p>
<p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
choosing a secondary school that would be a good fit for the student’s
overall educational needs, strengths and interests, students and parents
are encouraged to consider a holistic range of factors. This includes the
school’s distinctive programmes, subject offerings, Co-Curricular Activities,
ethos, culture, location and support for Special Educational Needs, if
required. Students are strongly encouraged to include at least 2 to 3 schools
within their 6 school choices where their PSLE score is better than the
school’s previous year’s cut-off points. This will help increase their
chances of securing a place in one of their preferred schools.</p>
<p>10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a more holistic
understanding of the offerings by the 140 secondary schools taking part
in the 2024 S1 Posting Exercise, students and parents can visit SchoolFinder
(<a href="https://moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder</a>).
Students and parents are encouraged to take the time to explore the schools’
websites, social media pages, as well as take part in their open houses
(<a href="https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/open-house-for-secondary-schools-2024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/open-house-for-secondary-schools-2024</a>),
to find out more about the schools that interest them before selecting
the schools.</p>

Results. Students should refer to their posted schools’ websites for more
information such as the reporting details, booklist, and purchase of books
and uniforms. Parents of the incoming S1 cohort who are on Parents Gateway

<p>13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If students are unable
to report to their posted secondary school on the first day of school in
January 2025 due to valid reasons, they should inform their posted secondary
school directly after receiving their posting results to confirm that they
are taking up the place, and the school will reserve the place for them.
