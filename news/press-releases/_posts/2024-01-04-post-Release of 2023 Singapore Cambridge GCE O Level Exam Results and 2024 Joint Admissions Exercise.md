a unique password. Interested students should use the respective passwords
to submit their applications online via the PFP website at https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/index.html.
More information on the eligibility requirements for the PFP, as well as
how GCE O-Level results are considered in the computation of the ELMAB3
