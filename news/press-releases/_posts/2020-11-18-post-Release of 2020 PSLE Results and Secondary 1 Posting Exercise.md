<p>1. The results of the 2020 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will
be released on Wednesday, 25 November 2020. Given the ongoing COVID-19
situation, arrangements have been made for school candidates to receive
their results from their respective primary schools – in their individual
classrooms instead of gathered as a cohort in the school hall as in previous
years – from 11.00am on 25 November 2020.</p>
<p>2. We recognise that having the opportunity to collect their examination
results in person is an important part of the educational journey, as it
gives students the opportunity to be with their classmates and consult
their teachers face-to-face on their next steps, if necessary.</p>
<p>3. Candidates collecting their results in school will be expected to observe
the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) that were announced earlier. For PSLE
students, given their younger age, one parent/guardian can accompany their
child/ward to school to collect their PSLE results. To minimise congestion
and intermingling, parents/guardians would need to wait at the designated
areas in the schools and observe the SMMs in place while their child/ward
receives the results in the classroom. Parents/guardians would not be allowed
to access or wait near the classrooms.</p>
<p>4. School candidates who are unwell, or who are on Quarantine Order, Stay-Home
Notice or Leave of Absence on the day of the results release, should not
return to school to collect their results. Instead, they may view their
results online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB)
results release system at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a> from 11.30am
on 25 November 2020, with a system-generated password that they have received
from their schools. The system will be accessible from 25 November 2020
to 8 December 2020.</p>
<p>5. School candidates can also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy
of their results on their behalf. Proxies are required to collect the results
by Friday, 27 November, and produce the relevant documents for the school’s
verification. If school candidates have not received their password for
SEAB’s results release system, or are unable to appoint a proxy to collect
their results, they may contact their school for assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Submission of Secondary 1 Options</strong>
</p>
<p>6. The Secondary 1 (S1) Option Forms to select secondary schools will
be given to eligible students when they collect their results slips in
person. There will not be online copies of the S1 Option Forms. Candidates’
proxies may also collect their S1 Option Forms on behalf of the candidates
by Friday, 27 November. If candidates are not able to collect their S1
Option Forms from their schools or appoint a proxy to do so, they may contact
their school for assistance. Students should discuss their secondary school
choices with their parents before they complete the S1 Option Forms.</p>
<p>7. In every S1 Option Form, there will be a unique S1 Personal Identification
Number (S1 PIN) which can be found at the top right-hand corner of the
form. The S1 PIN can be used to submit the secondary school options online
and view the posting outcome subsequently via the Secondary 1 Internet
System (S1-IS). The S1-IS will be accessible from 11.00am on Wednesday,
25 November 2020 to 3.00pm on Tuesday, 1 December 2020 for students to
submit their school choices through the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) S1
Posting website at www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting.</p>
<p>8. Students, in discussion with their parents, should first consider their
secondary school choices, make their decision, and complete the option
form before logging on to the S1-IS. This will help to facilitate the smooth
completion of their online submission. Alternatively, parents may contact
the student’s primary school and seek their assistance to submit the S1
options before 3.00pm on Tuesday, 1 December 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Release of Secondary 1 Posting Results</strong>
</p>
<p>9. The S1 Posting Results will be released on Tuesday, 22 December 2020.
The posting results can be accessed through any of the following channels:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Short Message Service (SMS) via a local mobile number (if provided by
the applicant during the application process)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S1-IS (www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting) using the student’s Birth Certificate
number / FIN, and the S1 PIN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the student’s primary school</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>10. In light of the COVID-19 situation, students do not need to report
to their posted secondary schools this year after receiving their S1 Posting
Results. Instead, students should refer to their posted schools’ websites
from 22 December 2020 for more information such as instructions on online
purchase of books and uniforms, booklist, and the reporting details. Parents
of the incoming S1 cohort who are on Parents Gateway (PG) would also receive
instructions from the posted schools from the afternoon of the day the
S1 Posting results are released.</p>
<p>11. If students are unable to report to their posted secondary school
on the first day of school in January 2021 due to valid reasons, they may
contact their posted secondary school directly to confirm that they are
taking up the place, and the school will be able to reserve the place for
them. More information on S1 Posting and S1-IS are available at MOE’s S1
Posting website and in the information booklet “Choosing Your Secondary
Schools” distributed to Primary 6 students. For enquiries, please visit

<p><strong>Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>12. Specialised Schools for Normal (Technical) students (SSNTs) – Crest
Secondary School (CSS) and Spectra Secondary School (SSS) – offer an alternative
educational pathway for students eligible for the Normal (Technical) course,
who have an interest in practice-oriented, hands-on learning. The schools
offer a customised skills-based curriculum and exposure to authentic learning
opportunities, putting students in good stead for progression to the Institute
of Technical Education (ITE). The SSNTs also provide a whole-school environment
that emphasises values, socio-emotional learning and character-building
- which in turn helps to nurture more holistic and confident learners who
are ready for future challenges.</p>
<p>13. Students in the SSNTs will study GCE Normal (Technical)-Level English
Language, Mother Tongue Language and Mathematics. Selected students can
take Science as an additional subject. As part of Subject-Based Banding,
eligible students can also take selected subjects at Normal (Academic)-Level.
Secondary 3 students will also specialise in two of five skills subjects<sup>1</sup> offered
under the new ITE Skills Subject Certificate (ISSC). The ISSC will replace
the ITE Skills Certificate (ISC) from the 2021 Secondary 3 batch, providing
a more broad-based curriculum that widens students’ exposure to different
industry growth areas.</p>
<p>14. Students who are eligible for the Normal (Technical) course and are
interested to study in CSS or SSS may submit their application during the
Pre-Registration Exercise at the respective schools from 25 November to
28 November 2020. They may also submit their applications via email or
directly to the school’s Admin Office. The deadline for applications is
1 December 2020, 3.00pm. At the same time, these students should also indicate
their choices for other secondary schools under S1 Posting. This will ensure
that those who are not admitted into CSS or SSS can be posted to another
school of their choice in a timely and seamless manner.</p>
<p>15. Application forms for these two schools are available at students’
respective primary schools, or online (<a href="https://www.crestsec.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.crestsec.edu.sg</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.spectra.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.spectra.edu.sg</u>
</a>). Students successfully admitted into CSS or SSS will be informed by
the schools by Wednesday, 16 December 2020. Their S1 school choices will
then be voided and they will not be posted to other secondary schools.
More information on CSS and SSS can be found on the schools’ websites and
the information booklet “Choosing Your Secondary Schools”.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Open Houses</strong>
</p>
<p>16. Due to the COVID-19 situation, more than 120 secondary schools are
conducting their open houses virtually. This will provide prospective students
and their parents the opportunity to get a glimpse of the school’s environment,
programmes and culture, while minimising intermingling and the risk of
infection. Programmes and activities planned for these virtual open houses
include virtual tours led by students, live Q&amp;A sessions on social
media platforms, as well as sharing of videos featuring testimonies from
parents and alumni members.</p>
<p>17. Choosing a secondary school is an important milestone in a student’s
educational journey. Parents and students should consider factors such
as the secondary schools’ distinctive programmes, Co-Curricular Activities
(CCAs), ethos and culture, to select schools that would best fit the educational
needs of the child. Parents and students are encouraged to take the time
to explore the schools’ websites, social media pages, as well as take part
in their virtual open houses, to find out more about the schools that interest
them before selecting the schools. For more information, please refer to:</p>
