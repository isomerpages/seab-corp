<p><strong>PROGRESSION TO SECONDARY 5 NORMAL (ACADEMIC)</strong>
</p>
<p>5. 77.7% of the school candidates from the N(A) course are eligible for
promotion to Secondary 5 N(A). These are school candidates in the N(A)
course who obtained an aggregate not exceeding 19 points in English Language,
Mathematics and the best three subjects (ELMAB3), and at least a Grade

<p><strong>PROGRESSION PATHWAYS FOR NORMAL (ACADEMIC) STUDENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>6. Secondary 4 N(A) students who sat for the GCE N(A)-Level Examinations
in 2020 and obtained a raw ELMAB3 aggregate not exceeding 19 points<sup>4</sup> will
have the option of applying for the Direct-Entry Scheme to Polytechnic
Programme (DPP).</p>
<p>7. The DPP prepares Secondary 4 N(A) students for progression into selected
polytechnic diploma courses via a two-year Higher Nitec programme at the
Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Under the DPP, students who successfully
complete their Higher Nitec course and attain the minimum qualifying Grade
Point Average (GPA) are guaranteed a place in a polytechnic diploma course
mapped to their Higher Nitec course.</p>
<p>8. About 1,200 DPP places will be offered across all three ITE Colleges.
Applications for the DPP will open on 17 December 2020. For more information,

<p>9. Secondary 4 N(A) students who sat for the GCE N(A)-Level Examinations

Programme (PFP). Students are eligible to apply for the PFP if they have
obtained a raw ELMAB3 aggregate not exceeding 12 points, and meet the subject-specific
requirements for their chosen course<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>10. The PFP is a one-year foundation programme at the polytechnics that
offers a practice-oriented curriculum taught by polytechnic lecturers,
to prepare students for entry into the relevant polytechnic diploma courses.
Upon completion of the PFP, students will progress to their pre-selected
diploma course, subject to them passing all modules in the PFP.</p>
<p>11. The polytechnics will offer about 1,500 PFP places in total. Applications
for the PFP will open in January 2021, on the day of the GCE O-Level Examination
results release. Secondary 4 N(A) students who intend to apply for the
PFP should first progress to Secondary 5 on 4 January 2021. For more information,
