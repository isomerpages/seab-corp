<p><strong>Results Release for School Candidates</strong>
</p>
<p>2. Arrangements have been made for school candidates to receive their
results from their secondary schools in their respective classrooms from

will be allowed into the school premises, and they will be expected to
observe the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in place.</p>
<p>3. School candidates issued with the Ministry of Health's Health Risk
Warning will be allowed to collect their results in person if they test
negative using the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) on the day of the results release
before going to school. School candidates who are unwell or are required
to self-isolate due to a positive COVID-19 test result should not return
to school to collect their results. These students may check their results
online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates
Portal at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a> from

can use their Singpass account to access SEAB’s Candidates Portal. School
candidates who are International Students will receive their system-generated
username via email from 7 January 2022. SEAB’s Candidates Portal will be
accessible from 12 to 26 January 2022.</p>
<p>4. School candidates who are unable to collect their results in person
should inform their schools and can appoint a proxy to collect a physical
copy of their results on their behalf. Proxies are required to produce
the relevant documents for the school’s verification when collecting the
results. School candidates may contact their schools for assistance if
they are unable to appoint a proxy, or if they have not received their
system- generated username for SEAB’s Candidates Portal.</p>
<p><strong>Results Release for Private Candidates</strong>
</p>
<p>5. Private candidates will be notified of their individual results by
post. The results will be mailed on 12 January 2022 to the address that
private candidates had provided to SEAB.</p>
<p>6. Private candidates who are eligible for Singpass can also use their
Singpass account to obtain their results online via SEAB’s Candidates Portal,
similar to the arrangement for school candidates. Private candidates who

email.</p>
