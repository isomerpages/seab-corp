<p>1. The results of the 2019 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of
Education Advanced Level (GCE A-Level) examination will be released next
Friday, 21 February 2020. School candidates may collect their results from
their respective schools from 2.30pm that same day.</p>
<p>2. In line with current precautionary measures to protect students and
staff in school against COVID-19, candidates who are collecting their results
in person must declare their travel history and take their temperature
before they arrive in school. They will also collect their results in smaller
groups in classrooms, instead of congregating in the school halls. Only
candidates collecting their results will be allowed entry into the school
premises.</p>
<p>3. School candidates who are not well, on Quarantine Order (QO) or Leave
of Absence (LOA) as of Friday, 21 February 2020, or who are affected by
travel restrictions to Singapore, should not report to their schools. Instead,
these school candidates may view their results online.</p>
<p>4. Private candidates will be notified of their results by post. The result
slips and certificates will be mailed to the postal address provided by
the candidates during the registration period.</p>
<p><u>Viewing of Examination Results Online</u>
</p>
<p>5. In view of the COVID-19 situation, all school and private candidates
will be able to view their results online via the results release system
using SingPass or system-generated passwords. Candidates who are eligible
for SingPass<sup>1</sup>, but have not activated it, will receive a SingPass
PIN mailer by Wednesday, 19 February 2020. The Singapore Examinations and
Assessment Board (SEAB) will provide each candidate who is not eligible
for SingPass with login details via email, also by Wednesday, 19 February
2020.</p>
<p>6. Results can be accessed via the results release system on SEABâ€™s website
(<a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.seab.gov.sg</a>)
from 3pm on Friday, 21 February 2020.</p>
<p><u>Digital Certificates and Applications to Autonomous Universities</u>
</p>
<p>7. Starting this year, all A-Level candidates who are Singapore Citizens
and Singapore Permanent Residents will receive digital certificates in
OpenCerts format. These certificates will be available via the MySkillsFuture
Skills Passport at https://www.myskillsfuture.sg/content/portal/en/individual/skills-passport.html
from Monday, 24 February 2020. Candidates with SingPass can access and
submit their digital certificates electronically to the universities they
are applying to. School candidates who are international students and unable
to access the portal may email SEAB at <a href="mailto:seab_gce_admin@seab.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">seab_gce_admin@seab.gov.sg</a> to
request for a copy of their digital certificates.</p>
<p>8. Applications for admissions and/or scholarships to the Autonomous Universities
(AUs) can be done online. All school candidates who apply to the AUs online
do not need to submit a copy of their A-Level certificates. Due to the
COVID-19 situation, the AUs will make alternative arrangements for any
assessment for admissions, if applicants cannot be physically present.</p>
<p><u>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</u>
</p>
<p>9. Students who need guidance on their education options can approach
their teachers or the ECG Counsellors supporting their schools. Students
can also refer to the interactive MySkillsFuture portal at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/mysfpreu" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/mysfpreu</a> to
