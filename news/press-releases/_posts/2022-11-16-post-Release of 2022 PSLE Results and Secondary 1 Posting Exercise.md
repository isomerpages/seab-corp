<p>1. The results of the 2022 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will
be released on Wednesday, 23 November 2022. Arrangements have been made
for school candidates to receive their results from their respective primary
schools from 11.00am on Wednesday, 23 November 2022.</p>
<p>2. Parents/guardians may accompany their child/ward to their school to
collect their PSLE results. Details on the collection arrangements will
be shared by the respective schools.</p>
<p>3. School candidates who are unwell or self-isolating due to a positive
COVID-19 test result should not return to school to collect their results.
They have the option of accessing their results online<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;
via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates Portal
at <a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a> from
11.45am on Wednesday, 23 November 2022 till 11.59pm on Tuesday, 6 December
2022. School candidates would have received their user account issued by
SEAB through their schools from Tuesday, 15 November 2022.</p>
<p>4. School candidates can also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy
of their results on their behalf from the school. Proxies are required
to collect the results by Friday, 25 November 2022, and produce the relevant
documents for the school’s verification. If school candidates have not
received their user account for SEAB’s Candidates Portal, or are unable
to appoint a proxy to collect their results, they may contact their school
for assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Choosing Secondary Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Students, in discussion with their parents, are encouraged to
consider schools holistically in choosing a secondary school that would
be a good fit for their educational needs, strengths and interests. While
schools’ PSLE Cut-Off Points from last year’s S1 Posting Exercise can serve
as a reference, students and parents are encouraged to also consider factors
such as the school culture, distinctive programmes, subject offerings,
and Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs).</p>
<p>6. Students are encouraged to visit the schools’ open houses and explore
their websites. More information is available at:</p>

<p><strong>Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>7. Specialised Schools for Normal (Technical) students (SSNTs) – Crest
Secondary School (CSS) and Spectra Secondary School (SSS) – offer an alternative
educational pathway for students eligible for the Normal (Technical) course,
who have an interest in practice-oriented, hands-on learning. The schools
offer a customised skills-based curriculum and exposure to unique learning
opportunities, putting students in good stead for progression to the Institute
of Technical Education (ITE). The SSNTs also provide a whole-school approach
that emphasises values, socio-emotional learning and character-building.
This in turn helps to nurture holistic and confident learners who are ready
to seize the opportunities of the future.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>8. Students in the SSNTs will typically study GCE Normal (Technical)-Level
English Language, Mother Tongue Language and Mathematics. Selected students
can take Science as an additional subject. In line with the spirit of Subject-Based
Banding, students with the aptitude for these subjects may also take them
at a more demanding level. Secondary 3 students will specialise in two
of five skills subjects<sup>2</sup> offered under the ITE Skills Subject
Certificate (ISSC). The ISSC provides a broad-based curriculum that widens
students’ exposure to different industry growth areas, allowing students
to better discover their interests and make more informed choices about
their post-secondary education and future careers.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>9. More information on CSS and SSS can be found on their school websites
(<a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.crestsec.edu.sg</u></a> and
<a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.spectra.edu.sg</u>
</a>). The schools’ websites also contain information on their Pre-Registration
Experiences, where students and their parents can register to visit the
schools in small groups to find out more about the schools’ distinctive
programmes, subjects, culture, ethos and other offerings. Eligible students
who are interested to study in CSS or SSS can submit their school application
during the Pre-Registration Exercise at the respective schools from Wednesday,
23 November to Saturday, 26 November 2022. Application forms for these
two schools are available at students’ respective primary schools, or on
CSS and SSS’ school websites. Students may also submit their applications
via email or directly to the CSS and SSS’ Admin Office by 3.00pm, Tuesday,
29 November 2022.
<br>
<br>10. Students who have applied to CSS or SSS should continue to also indicate
their choices for other secondary schools under Secondary 1 (S1) Posting.
This will ensure that those who are not admitted into CSS or SSS can be
posted to another school of their choice in a timely and seamless manner.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>11. Students successfully admitted into CSS or SSS will be informed by
the schools by Wednesday, 14 December 2022. Their S1 school choices will
then be voided and they will not be posted to other secondary schools.</p>
<p><strong>Submission of Secondary 1 School Choices and Options</strong>
</p>
<p>12. The S1 Option Form to select secondary schools will be given to eligible
students together with their PSLE results. The S1 Option Form provides
key information regarding the submission of school choices.
<br>
<br>13. A unique S1 Personal Identification Number (S1 PIN) can be found on
the top-right hand corner of the S1 Option Form. Students should use the
S1 PIN to log in to the Secondary 1 Internet System (S1-IS) and submit
their S1 school choices and options online. The S1-IS will be accessible
from 11.30am on Wednesday, 23 November 2022 to 3.00pm on Tuesday, 29 November
2022 through MOE’s S1 Posting website at <a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</u></a>.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>14. Students, in discussion with their parents, should first consider
their school choices and complete the S1 Option Form before logging on
to the S1-IS to submit their S1 school choices and options. This will help
to facilitate the smooth completion of their online submission. Parents
who require assistance with their online submission may contact the student’s
primary school before 3.00pm on Tuesday, 29 November 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Release of Secondary 1 Posting Results</strong>
</p>
<p>15. The S1 Posting Results will be released between Wednesday, 21 December
2022 and Friday, 23 December 2022. The posting results can be accessed
through any of the following channels:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Short Message Service (SMS) via a local mobile number (if provided by
the applicant during the application process);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S1-IS (<a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</u></a>)
using the student’s Birth Certificate number / FIN, and the S1 PIN; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the student’s primary school</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>16. Students do not need to report to their posted secondary schools upon
receiving their S1 Posting Results. Students should refer to their posted
schools’ websites after receiving their posting results for more information
such as the reporting details, booklist, and purchase of books and uniforms.
Parents of the incoming S1 cohort who are on Parents Gateway (PG) will
also receive instructions from the posted schools from the afternoon the
S1 Posting results are released.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>17. If students are unable to report to their posted secondary school
on the first day of school in January 2023 due to valid reasons, they should
inform their posted secondary school directly after receiving their posting
results to confirm that they are taking up the place, and the school will
be able to reserve the place for them. More information on S1 Posting and
S1-IS are available at MOE’s S1 Posting website. For enquiries, please
visit <a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.moe.gov.sg/contact</u></a>.</p>
<p><strong><sup>1 School candidates viewing their results online can still contact their schools and teachers for consultation on their next steps.</sup></strong>
