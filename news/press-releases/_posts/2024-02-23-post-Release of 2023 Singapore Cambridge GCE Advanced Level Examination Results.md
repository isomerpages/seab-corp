<p>2.&nbsp;A total of 10,899 candidates sat for the 2023 GCE A-Level examination.
10,238 (93.9%) of these candidates have attained at least 3 H2 passes,
with a pass in General Paper (GP) or Knowledge and Inquiry (KI). This is
comparable to the performance of candidates for the GCE A-Level Examination
in previous years.</p>
<p><strong>Applications to Autonomous Universities</strong>
</p>
<p>3. Interested applicants for admissions and/or scholarships to the Autonomous
Universities (AUs) should submit their applications online. There is no
need to submit a hard copy of their GCE A-Level certificates. More information
on the AUs’ admissions processes can be found on their respective websites,
and applicants can approach the AUs directly for further clarifications.</p>
<p><strong>Applications to Polytechnics</strong>
</p>
<p>4. Eligible GCE A-Level graduates who are looking to further their studies
at the polytechnics can benefit from module exemptions in about 135 courses.
This can potentially reduce the time taken for them to obtain a polytechnic
diploma by up to one year. Interested students should apply directly to
the polytechnics from 23 February to 7 March 2024, for matriculation in
April 2024. Students may also apply in August 2024 for matriculation in
October 2024. More details can be found on the respective polytechnics’
websites</p>
