O-Level results to apply for a place in the Polytechnic Foundation Programme
(PFP) and Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP).</p>
<p><u>Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP)</u>
</p>
<p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PFP is an alternative to the Secondary
5 N(A) year. It is a one-year foundation programme offered at the polytechnics
which provides students with a practice-oriented approach to prepare them
for entry into the relevant diploma courses.</p>
<p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are eligible to apply for the
PFP if they obtain a raw ELMAB3 aggregate<a href="#_ftn7" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[7]</a> of 12 points or lower and meet the subject-specific
requirements for their chosen cluster.</p>
<p>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PFP-eligible
students will receive a copy of <u>Form&nbsp;P</u> from their respective
secondary schools in person. Interested students are required to submit
their applications online via the PFP website at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/index.html </a>using
their Singpass account. More information on the eligibility requirements
for the PFP, as well as how GCE O-Level results are considered in the computation
of the ELMAB3 aggregate, can be found on the PFP website indicated above.</p>
<p>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applications for the PFP will open from
1.30pm on 14 January 2026, to 4.30pm on 19 January 2026. The PFP posting
results will be released at 1.30pm on 26 January 2026 through the PFP website.
Students will be required to indicate whether they wish to accept, reject,
or appeal for a change of course by 4.30pm on 29 January 2026.</p>
<p><u>Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP)</u>
</p>
<p>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DPP<a href="#_ftn8" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[8]</a> prepares students for progression into selected polytechnic
diploma courses via a two-year <em>Higher Nitec </em>course at ITE. Students
are eligible to apply if they obtain a raw ELMAB3 aggregate of 19 points
or lower and meet the subject-specific requirements for their chosen course.</p>
<p>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eligible Secondary 4 N(A) students may
submit their DPP applications online via the DPP application portal <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">at www.ite.edu.sg/apply-for-ite-courses</a>.
Applications for the DPP will open from 12am on 14 January 2026 to 11.59pm
on 19 January 2026.</p>
<p>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DPP posting results for applications
made under the final application phase will be released at 9am on 21 January
2026 through the DPP application portal. Students will be required to indicate
whether they accept or reject the DPP offer by 11.59pm on 26 January 2026.</p>
<p><u>For successful DPP and/or PFP applicants</u>
</p>
<p>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who have been offered a place
in the DPP under the final application phase should report to ITE on 26
January 2026 upon acceptance of their DPP course offer.</p>
<p>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last day of school for Secondary
5 students who have accepted a place in the PFP will be on 30 January 2026.
Students will be informed by the respective polytechnics on the enrolment
dates for the PFP.</p>
<p>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who have accepted a place in
the earlier application phase of the DPP in December but decide to take
up a PFP offer must withdraw from the DPP first before they are able to
take up the PFP offer. DPP-enrolled students should check with their ITE
class advisor for more details on the DPP withdrawal process and deadlines
for withdrawal.</p>
