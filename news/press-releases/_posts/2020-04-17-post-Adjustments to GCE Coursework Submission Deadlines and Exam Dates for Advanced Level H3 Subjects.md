  For A Level H3 Subjects

<p>1. Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) recognises that
the full Home-Based Learning (HBL), which has been implemented from 8 April
to 4 May 2020, will have certain implications on students taking GCE-Level
coursework and GCE A- Level H3 subjects taught by Autonomous Universities
(AUs). Therefore, SEAB will be making some adjustments in these two areas,
to ensure that students are fairly assessed.</p>
<p><strong>GCE-LEVEL COURSEWORK – EXTENSION OF NATIONAL SUBMISSION DEADLINES &amp; SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES</strong>
</p>
<p>2. There are 34 GCE N(T)-, N(A)-, O- and A-Level subjects that have a
coursework component as part of the national examination framework.</p>
<p>3. Most of the coursework cannot be done at home due to the need for face-to-face
teacher supervision or the use of school facilities and equipment - for
instance, the use of studios for Music, food laboratories for Food and
Nutrition, studios for Design and Technology, and sports equipment and
facilities for Exercise and Sports Science.</p>
<p>4. Given HBL’s impact on coursework, SEAB will apply three methods to
ensure that the assessment remains fair and accurate:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Extend the national submission deadline by two weeks, where possible.
The extension takes into consideration about two weeks of curriculum time
that could be recovered with the cancellation of the schools’ mid-year
examinations, and that any extension of deadline should not overlap with
the school preliminary examinations and national examinations. The extension
will give students more time to complete the coursework and help reduce
the anxiety of students and teachers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SEAB will also consider adjusting the task requirements where appropriate
- for example by reducing the number of assessment tasks, as long as such
adjustments do not compromise the validity of assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SEAB will also accept evidence of learning from the schools and apply
special consideration in grading the candidates in these coursework subjects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5. There are 12 GCE-Level subjects which will have their coursework submission
deadlines extended by two weeks. (Please see Annex A).</p>
<p>6. For 10 GCE-Level subjects, their coursework submission deadlines cannot
be extended as their submission deadlines are very close to school preliminary
examinations or year-end national examinations. (Please see Annex B). The
submission deadlines for the remaining 12 GCE A-Level subjects, for which
the coursework components can be carried out independently through research
and independent study, will remain.</p>
<p>7. In the event that full HBL is extended and that coursework national
submission deadlines cannot be further extended without overlapping with
school preliminary examinations, students should submit the coursework
that they have so far completed. SEAB has established processes to ensure
that these students will still be fairly assessed.</p>
<p><strong>GCE A-LEVEL H3 SUBJECTS TAUGHT BY AUTONOMOUS UNIVERSITIES – RESCHEDULING &amp; DECENTRALISATION OF FINAL EXAMINATIONS</strong>
</p>
<p>8. The national examinations for GCE A-Level H3 subjects that are taught
by the local Autonomous Universities (AUs) will be rescheduled to take
place only after the end of the full HBL period:</p>

<p>9. The national examinations for these H3 programmes will be decentralised
at the students’ respective junior colleges and Millennia Institute. The
schools will implement the necessary precautionary measures to ensure the
safety and well-being of all students and examination personnel.</p>
<p>10. SEAB will continue to work closely with schools to provide guidance
to students on examination matters. As previously mentioned, current plans
are that all national examinations, including the mid-year GCE O- and A-Level
Mother Tongue Language examinations in June, will proceed as scheduled,
since these are essential milestones for students in their educational
journey. If any changes are required, given the fluidity of the current
COVID-19 situation, we will certainly provide timely updates.</p>
