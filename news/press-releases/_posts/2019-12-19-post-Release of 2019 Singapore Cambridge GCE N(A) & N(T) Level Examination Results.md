<p><strong>PROGRESSION TO SECONDARY 5 NORMAL (ACADEMIC)</strong>
</p>
<p>4. 76.6% of the students from the N(A) course are eligible for promotion
to Secondary 5 N(A). These are students in the N(A) course who obtained
an aggregate not exceeding 19 points in English Language, Mathematics and
the best three subjects (ELMAB3), and at least a Grade 5 for all subjects
used in the computation of the ELMAB3.</p>
<p>5. This year, 38.1% of the students from the N(A) course sat for subjects
in the GCE Ordinary Level (GCE O-Level) Examinations. Schools will take
into consideration their combined GCE N(A)-Level and school-based O-Level
preliminary examination results when determining their eligibility for
Secondary 5 N(A) or post-secondary pathways.</p>
<p><strong>PROGRESSION PATHWAYS FOR NORMAL (ACADEMIC) STUDENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>6. Secondary 4 N(A) students who sat for the GCE N(A)-Level Examinations
in 2019 and obtained a raw ELMAB3 aggregate not exceeding 19 points<sup>4</sup> will
have the option of applying for the Direct-Entry Scheme to Polytechnic
Programme (DPP).</p>
<p>7. The DPP prepares Secondary 4 N(A) students for progression into selected
polytechnic diploma courses via a two-year Higher Nitec programme at the
Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Under the DPP, students who successfully
complete their Higher Nitec course and attain the minimum qualifying Grade
Point Average (GPA) are guaranteed a place in a polytechnic diploma course
mapped to their Higher Nitec course.</p>
<p>8. About 1,200 DPP places will be offered across all three ITE Colleges.
Applications for the DPP will open on 19 December 2019. For more information,
please refer to https://www.ite.edu.sg/admissions/full-time-courses/higher-nitec/dpp/.</p>
<p>9. Secondary 4 N(A) students who sat for the GCE N(A)-Level Examinations
in 2019 also have the option of applying for the Polytechnic Foundation
Programme (PFP). Students are eligible to apply for the PFP if they have
obtained a raw ELMAB3 aggregate not exceeding 12 points, and meet the subject-specific
requirements for their chosen course5.</p>
<p>10. The PFP is a one-year foundation programme at the polytechnics that
offers a practice-oriented curriculum taught by polytechnic lecturers,
to prepare students for entry into the relevant polytechnic diploma courses.
Upon completion of the PFP, students will progress to their pre-selected
diploma course, subject to them passing all modules in the PFP.</p>
<p>11. The polytechnics will offer about 1,500 PFP places in total. Applications
for the PFP will open in January 2020, on the day of the GCE O-Level Examination
results release. Secondary 4 N(A) students who intend to apply for the
PFP should first progress to Secondary 5 on 2 January 2020. For more information,
please refer to https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/index.html.</p>
<p>12. All N(A) course students who have completed their secondary education
may also apply to further their studies through ITE’s Nitec programmes.
For more information on courses available at ITE, please refer to https://www.ite.edu.sg/courses/full-time-courses/nitec/.</p>
<p>PROGRESSION PATHWAYS FOR NORMAL (TECHNICAL) STUDENTS</p>
<p>13. All N(T) course students who complete their secondary education in
2019 may apply to further their studies through ITE’s Nitec programmes.
For more information on courses available at ITE, please refer to https://www.ite.edu.sg/courses/full-time-courses/nitec/.</p>
<p>14. Schools may also laterally transfer Secondary 4 N(T) students to Secondary
4 N(A) if they have obtained grade A for both English Language and Mathematics,
and grade B or better for one other subject at the GCE N(T)-Level Examination.</p>
<p>PROVISION OF EDUCATION AND CAREER GUIDANCE (ECG) SERVICES</p>
<p>15. Students are advised to select courses based on their strengths and
interest in the field of study. Students can discuss their options with
teachers and Education and Career Guidance (ECG) counsellors at their respective
schools. Alternatively, students can also make an appointment to see an
ECG counsellor at the MOE ECG Centre via the online booking system: https://bit.ly/moe_ecg,
phone: 68311420 or email: MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg. The MOE ECG Centre is open
from 13 to 27 December 2019, 9.00am to 5.00pm.</p>
