<p>1. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Education (MOE)
and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) will ensure
that the arrangements for the release of results for the 2020 national
examinations take into account the need to safeguard the well-being of
candidates and school staff.</p>
<p><strong>Arrangements for the Collection of Results</strong>
</p>
<p>2. The tentative dates for the release of results for the respective national
examinations are indicated below. Due to operational factors, the exact
dates can only be confirmed later, about one week before each actual results
release day.</p>

<p>3. We recognise that being able to collect their examination results in
person is an important part of the educational journey for many students.
It gives them the opportunity to be with their classmates, and to consult
their teachers on their next steps, if necessary. As such, arrangements
will be made for school candidates to return to their respective schools
on the day of the results release, to collect their results from their
teachers personally.</p>
<p>4. As is the standard practice now, candidates collecting their results
in school will be expected to observe the Safe Management Measures (SMMs)
in place. They will also have to sign in via SafeEntry and be screened
for fever or flu-like symptoms. To avoid congestion, this year’s collection
of results will be done in small groups in individual classrooms, instead
of in large crowded venues like the school hall in previous years.</p>
<p>5. As PSLE candidates, given their younger age, might need more support,
one parent/guardian will be allowed to accompany his/her child/ward to
school to collect their results. The parents/guardians would need to wait
at the designated common areas in the schools and observe the SMMs implemented,
while their child/ward receives the results in the classroom. For the collection
of GCE-level examination results, only school candidates will be allowed
entry into school premises.</p>
<p>6. As with current practice, private candidates will be notified of their
results by post. The results slip and certificates will be mailed to the
postal address provided by these candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Arrangements to View Results Online</strong>
</p>
<p>7. This year, SEAB has enhanced its systems so that all candidates will
also be able to view their examination results online on the day of the
respective results release. This can be done via SEAB’s results release
system on its website (<a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a>).</p>
<p>8. School candidates who are unwell, or who are on Quarantine Order, Stay-Home
Notice or Leave of Absence on the day of the results release, should not
return to school to collect their results. They should view their results
online instead. The physical copy of their results can be collected from
their respective schools at a later date. School candidates who are unable
to collect their results in school may appoint a proxy to collect a physical
copy of their results, as well as the Secondary 1 Option Form, Joint Admissions
Exercise Form, Polytechnic Foundation Programme form or Joint Intake Exercise
form on their behalf. If they are unable to appoint a proxy to collect
their results, they may contact their school for assistance to send the
results and related forms to them.</p>
<p>9. Candidates can access SEAB’s results release system with a system-generated
password issued by SEAB, or with their SingPass:</p>
<p>a. PSLE candidates will receive a system-generated password issued by
SEAB through their schools from 12 November 2020.
<br>b. GCE-level candidates who are eligible for SingPass<sup>1</sup> should
activate their SingPass early. Candidates who are not eligible for SingPass
will receive a system-generated password from SEAB via email a few days
before the results release. More details will be provided in the respective
announcements on the dates of the GCE-level examinations’ results release.</p>
<p>10. MOE and SEAB will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely,
and provide updates if there are further changes to the arrangements for
this year’s release of results.</p>
<p><strong><sub>1 Candidates can visit the SingPass website at </sub><a href="http://www.singpass.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sub>www.singpass.gov.sg</sub></a><sub> to find out if they are eligible for SingPass, and to activate their SingPass Two-Factor Authentication if they have not done so.</sub></strong>
