<p>1. Candidates who sat for the 2021 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate
of Education (GCE) Normal (Academic) [N(A)] and Normal (Technical) [N(T)]
Level Examinations received their results today<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>2. Arrangements have been made for school candidates to receive their
results from their secondary schools in their respective classrooms. Only
school candidates collecting their results were allowed entry into the
school premises, with Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in place. Private
candidates will be notified of their individual result by post as per previous
years. All candidates are also able to access their results online via
the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates Portal
at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a>.</p>
<p>3. 9,407 candidates from the Secondary 4 N(A) course and 4,228 candidates
from the Secondary 4 N(T) course sat for the examinations. 9,356 (or 99.5%)
candidates from the N(A) course have been awarded the GCE N(A)-Level certificate<sup>2</sup>,
and 4,147 (or 98.1%) candidates from the N(T) course have been awarded
the GCE N(T)-Level certificate<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>4. This year, 50.3% of the school candidates from the N(A) course sat
for subjects in the GCE Ordinary Level (GCE O-Level) examinations. Schools
will take into consideration their combined GCE N(A)-Level and school-based
O-Level preliminary examination results when determining their eligibility
for progression to Secondary 5 N(A) or post-secondary pathways.</p>
<p><strong>Progression to Secondary 5 Normal (Academic)</strong>
</p>
<p>5. 79.2% of the school candidates from the N(A) course are eligible for
progression to Secondary 5 N(A). These candidates must have obtained an
aggregate not exceeding 19 points in English Language, Mathematics and
the best three subjects (ELMAB3), and at least a Grade 5 for all subjects
used in the computation of the ELMAB3.</p>
<p><strong>Progression Pathways for Normal (Academic) Students</strong>
</p>
<p>6. Secondary 4 N(A) students who sat for the GCE N(A)-Level Examinations
in 2021 as school candidates, obtained a raw ELMAB3 aggregate not exceeding
19 points<sup>4</sup>, and met subject-specific entry requirements for
their chosen course will have the option of applying for the Direct-Entry
Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP).</p>
<p>7. The DPP prepares Secondary 4 N(A) students for progression into mapped
polytechnic diploma courses via a two-year Higher Nitec programme at the
Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Under the DPP, students who successfully
complete their Higher Nitec course and attain the minimum qualifying Grade
Point Average (GPA) are guaranteed a place in a polytechnic diploma course
mapped to their Higher Nitec course.</p>
<p>8. About 1,200 DPP places will be offered across all three ITE Colleges.
Applications for the DPP will open on 17 December 2021. For more information,
please refer to <a href="https://www.ite.edu.sg/admissions/full-time-courses/higher-nitec-dpp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.ite.edu.sg/admissions/full-time-courses/higher-nitec-dpp</u></a>.</p>
<p>9. Secondary 4 N(A) students who sat for the GCE N(A)-Level Examinations
in 2021 as school candidates also have the option of applying for the Polytechnic
Foundation Programme (PFP). Students are eligible to apply for the PFP
if they have obtained a raw ELMAB3 aggregate not exceeding 12 points, and
meet the subject-specific requirements for their chosen course<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>10. The PFP is a one-year foundation programme at the polytechnics that
offers a practice-oriented curriculum taught by polytechnic lecturers,
to prepare students for entry into the relevant polytechnic diploma courses.
Upon completion of the PFP, students will progress to their pre-selected
diploma course, subject to them passing all modules in the PFP.</p>
<p>11. The polytechnics will offer about 1,500 PFP places in total. Applications
for the PFP will open in January 2022, on the day of the GCE O-Level Examination
results release. Secondary 4 N(A) students who intend to apply for the
PFP should first progress to Secondary 5 on 4 January 2022. All PFP-bound
students are required to attend their Secondary 5N(A) classes in their
secondary schools up till the last Friday of January 2022, i.e. 28 January
2022. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/index.html</u></a>.</p>
<p>12. All N(A) course students who have completed their secondary education
may also apply to further their studies through ITE’s two-year Nitec or
three-year Higher Nitec programmes. Starting from Academic Year 2022, ITE
will introduce the enhanced three-year curricular structure<sup>6</sup> leading
directly to a Higher Nitec certification. This will equip ITE graduates
with deeper industry-relevant skills for employment, as well as provide
a strong foundation for further education and skills upgrading over the
course of their careers. For more information on courses available at ITE,
please refer to <a href="https://www.ite.edu.sg/courses/full-time-courses/nitec-and-3-year-higher-nitec" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://www.ite.edu.sg/courses/full-time-courses/nitec-and-3-year-higher-nitec</u></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Progression Pathways for Normal (Technical) students</strong>
</p>
<p>13. All N(T) course students who complete their secondary education in
2021 may similarly apply to further their studies through ITE’s two-year
Nitec or three- year Higher Nitec programmes.</p>
<p>14. Schools may also laterally transfer Secondary 4 N(T) students to Secondary
4 N(A) if they have obtained Grade A for both English Language and Mathematics,
and Grade B or better for one other subject at the GCE N(T)-Level Examination.</p>
<p><strong>Provision of Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Services</strong>
</p>
<p>15. Candidates are advised to select courses based on their strengths
and interest in the field of study. School candidates may consult their
teachers or ECG Counsellors in their respective secondary schools to help
them make informed decisions about their next steps. To complement the
ECG services provided by schools, candidates may also make an appointment
for online or phone counselling with an ECG Counsellor from the ECG Centre
at MOE (Grange Road) via 6831 1420, <a href="mailto:MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>MOE_ECG@moe.gov.sg</u></a> or <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre</u></a>.
