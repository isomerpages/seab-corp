<p>1. The results of the 2019 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will
be released on Thursday, 21 November 2019. Students may obtain their results
from their respective primary schools from 11.00am on 21 November 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Submission of Secondary 1 Options</strong>
</p>
<p>2. Eligible students will receive option forms to select secondary schools
when they collect their results slips. Students should discuss their secondary
school choices with their parents before they complete the Secondary 1
(S1) Option Forms.</p>
<p>3. In every S1 Option Form, there will be a unique S1 Personal Identification
Number (S1 PIN) which can be found at the top right-hand corner of the
form. The S1 PIN can be used to submit the secondary school options online
and view the posting outcome subsequently via the Secondary 1 Internet
System (S1-IS). The S1-IS will be accessible from 11.00am on Thursday,
21 November 2019 to 3.00pm on Wednesday, 27 November 2019 for students
to submit their school choices through the Ministry of Education’s (MOE)
S1 Posting website at <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.moe.gov.sg/s1-posting</a>.</p>
<p>4. Students, in discussion with their parents, should first consider their
secondary school choices, make their decision, and complete the option
form before logging on to the S1-IS. This will help to facilitate the smooth
completion of their online submission.</p>
<p>5. Alternatively, the option form can be submitted through the student’s
primary school. Submission at primary schools can be made during the following
timeslots: 11.00am to 3.00pm on 21 November 2019, and 9.00am to 3.00pm

<p><strong>Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>9. Specialised Schools for Normal (Technical) students (SSNTs) - Crest
Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School – offer an alternative educational
pathway for students eligible for the Normal (Technical) course, who have
an interest in practice-oriented, hands-on learning. The schools offer
a customised skills-based curriculum and exposure to authentic learning
opportunities, putting students in good stead for progression to the ITE.
The SSNTs also provide a whole-school environment that emphasises values,
socio-emotional learning and character-building - which in turn helps to
nurture more holistic and confident learners who are ready for future challenges.</p>
<p>10. Students in the SSNTs will study GCE Normal (Technical)-Level English
Language, Mother Tongue Language and Mathematics. Selected students can
take Science as an additional subject. As part of Subject-Based Banding,
eligible students can also take selected subjects at Normal (Academic)-Level.
Secondary 3 students will be able to specialise in two of five skills subjects1
offered under the new ITE Skills Subject Certificate (ISSC) from 2021.
The ISSC will replace the ITE Skills Certificate (ISC), providing a more
broad-based curriculum that widens students’ exposure to different industry
growth areas.</p>
<p>11. Students who are eligible for the Normal (Technical) course and are
interested to study in Crest Secondary School or Spectra Secondary School
should apply directly to these schools from 11.00am on Thursday, 21 November
2019 until 3.00pm on Wednesday, 27 November 2019. At the same time, these
students should also indicate their choices for other secondary schools
under S1 Posting Exercise. This will ensure that those who are not admitted
into Crest or Spectra can be posted to another school of their choice in
a timely and seamless manner.</p>
<p>12. Application forms for these two schools are available at the primary
schools when students receive their results, or on the schools’ websites
(<a href="https://www.crestsec.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.crestsec.edu.sg/</a> and
<a href="https://www.spectra.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.spectra.edu.sg/</a>). Students successfully admitted into
Crest or Spectra will be informed by the schools by Friday, 13 December
2019. Their S1 school choices will be voided and they will not be posted
to other secondary schools under S1 Posting.</p>
<p>13. More information on Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School
can be found on the schools’ websites and the information booklet entitled
“Choosing Your Secondary Schools”.</p>
<p><strong><sub>1 The five skills subjects are Mechanical Design &amp; Automation, Culinary &amp; Restaurant Operations, Retail &amp; e-Commerce, Internet of Things Applications and Mobile Web Applications</sub></strong>
