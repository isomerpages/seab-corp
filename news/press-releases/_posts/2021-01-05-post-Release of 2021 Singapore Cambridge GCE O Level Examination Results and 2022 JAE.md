<p>1. The results of the 2020 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of
Education Ordinary Level (GCE O-Level) examination will be released on
Monday, 11 January 2021, 2.00pm.</p>
<p><strong>Results Release for School Candidates</strong>
</p>
<p>2. Given the COVID-19 situation, arrangements have been made for school
candidates to receive their results from their respective secondary schools
– in their individual classrooms instead of gathered as a cohort as in
previous years – from 2.00pm on 11 January 2021. Only school candidates
collecting their results will be allowed entry into the school premises,
and they will be expected to observe the Safe Management Measures (SMMs)
in place.</p>
<p>3. School candidates who are unwell, on Quarantine Order, Stay-Home Notice
or Leave of Absence on the day of the results release, should not return
to school to collect their results. Instead, they may view their results
online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) results
release system at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a> from 2.45pm on
11 January 2021. The system will be accessible from 11 to 25 January 2021.</p>
<p>4. School candidates who are eligible for SingPass<sup>1</sup> can use
their SingPass account to access SEAB’s online results release system.
School candidates who are International Students can access the results
release system using the SEAB-issued PIN sent to their email addresses
which their schools had provided to SEAB.</p>
<p>5. School candidates can also appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy
of their results on their behalf. Proxies are required to collect the results
by Wednesday, 13 January 2021, and produce the relevant documents for the
school’s verification. School candidates may contact their schools for
assistance if they are unable to appoint a proxy, or if they have not received
their password for SEAB’s results release system.</p>
<p><strong>Results Release for Private Candidates</strong>
</p>
<p>6. Private candidates will be notified of their individual results by
post. The result slips will be mailed on 11 January 2021 to the address
that private candidates had provided to SEAB. Private candidates who are
eligible for SingPass can also use their SingPass account to obtain their
results online via SEAB’s online results release system, similar to the
arrangement for school candidates. Private candidates who are non- SingPass
holders can use the SEAB-issued PIN sent to their email addresses which
they had provided to SEAB.</p>
<p><strong>Joint Admissions Exercise</strong>
</p>
<p>7. Students who wish to apply for admission to Junior Colleges (JC), Millennia
Institute, polytechnics, and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE)
may do so via the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) using their GCE O-Level
examination results.</p>
<p>8. Eligible school candidates who sat for the 2020 GCE O-Level examination
will receive <u>Form A</u><sup>2</sup> on Monday, 11 January 2021, when they
collect their O-Level results in person. Private candidates who are eligible
for JAE will continue to receive Form A via post sent to the address that
they had provided to SEAB earlier. There will not be online copies of the
Form A. Candidates’ proxies may also collect their Form A on behalf of
the candidates by Wednesday, 13 January 2021. If candidates are not able
to collect their Form A from their schools or appoint a proxy to do so,
they may contact their school for assistance.</p>
<p>9. The JAE-Internet System (JAE-IS) will be accessible from 3.00pm on
Monday, 11 January 2021, to 4.00pm on Friday, 15 January 2021 for students
