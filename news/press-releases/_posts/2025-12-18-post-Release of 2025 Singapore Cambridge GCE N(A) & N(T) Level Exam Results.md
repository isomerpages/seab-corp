<p>Candidates who sat for the 2025 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate
of Education (GCE) Normal (Academic) [N(A)] and Normal (Technical) [N(T)]
Level examinations received their results today<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8,987 candidates
from the Secondary 4 N(A) course and 4,479 candidates from the Secondary
4 N(T) course sat for the examinations. 8,934 (or 99.4%) candidates from
the N(A) course have achieved Grade 5 or better in at least one N(A) subject<sup>2</sup>,
while 4,375 (or 97.7%) candidates from the N(T) course have achieved Grade

<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year,<strong> </strong>56.3%
of the school candidates from the N(A) course sat for subjects in the GCE
Ordinary Level (GCE O-Level) examinations. Schools will take their combined
GCE N(A)-Level and school-based GCE O-Level preliminary examination results
into consideration when determining their eligibility for progression to
Secondary 5 N(A) or post-secondary pathways.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Progression to Secondary 5 Normal (Academic)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 76.4% of the school
candidates from the N(A) course are eligible for progression to Secondary
5 N(A)<sup>4</sup>.<a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> </a>These candidates must have obtained a raw aggregate
of 19 points or lower in English Language, Mathematics and the best three
subjects (ELMAB3)<sup>5</sup>, and at least a N(A)-Level Grade 5 for all
subjects used in the computation of the ELMAB3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Progression Pathways for Normal (Academic) Students</u></strong>
</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary 4 N(A)
students who sat for the GCE N(A)-Level Examinations in 2025 as school
candidates can apply for the <strong>Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP)</strong> if
they have obtained a raw ELMAB3 aggregate of 19 points or lower<sup>6</sup>,
and meet the subject-specific entry requirements for their chosen course.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DPP allows
Secondary 4 N(A) students to be admitted directly into a two-year Higher
Nitec course at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) without having
to sit for the GCE O-Level examinations. Under the DPP, students who successfully
complete their Higher Nitec<em> </em>course and attain the minimum qualifying
Grade Point Average (GPA)<sup>7</sup> are guaranteed a place in a polytechnic
diploma course mapped to their Higher Nitec<em> </em>course.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 1,200 DPP
places will be offered across all three ITE Colleges in Academic Year (AY)
2026. Applications for the DPP AY2026 intake will open on 18 December 2025.
For more information, please refer to <a href="https://www.ite.edu.sg/secondary-school-students/ite-full-time-courses/higher-nitec-for-dpp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">www.ite.edu.sg/secondary-school-students/ite-full-time-courses/higher-nitec-for-dpp</a>.</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary 4 N(A)
students who sat for the GCE N(A)-Level Examinations in 2025 as school
candidates can also apply for the <strong>Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP)</strong> if
they have obtained a raw ELMAB3 aggregate of 12 points or lower<sup>8</sup>,
and meet the subject-specific requirements for their chosen PFP cluster
or course.</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The PFP, an alternative to Secondary 5, is a one-year foundation programme
at the polytechnics that offers a practice-oriented curriculum taught by
polytechnic lecturers, to prepare students for entry into the relevant
polytechnic diploma courses. Upon completion of the PFP, students will
progress to one of the diploma courses within their pre-selected cluster,
subject to them passing all modules in the PFP.</p>
<p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The polytechnics
will offer about 2,000 PFP places in total. Applications for the PFP AY2026
intake will open in January 2026, on the day of the GCE O-Level Examination
results release. Secondary 4 N(A) students who intend to apply for the
PFP should first progress to Secondary 5 on 2 January 2026. All PFP-bound
students are required to attend their Secondary 5N(A) classes in their
secondary schools until the last Friday of January 2026, i.e. 30 January
2026. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All N(A) students who have
completed their secondary education may also further their studies through
ITE’s three-year Higher Nitec courses.</p>
<p><strong><u>Progression Pathways for Normal (Technical) students</u></strong>
</p>
<p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All N(T) students who have
completed their secondary education in 2025 may similarly further their
studies through ITE’s three-year Higher Nitec courses or four-year Higher
Nitec courses with Enhanced Foundation Programme.</p>
<p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools may also laterally
transfer Secondary 4 N(T) students to Secondary 4 N(A) if they have obtained
Grade A for both English Language and Mathematics, and Grade B or better
for one other subject at the GCE N(T)-Level Examination.</p>
