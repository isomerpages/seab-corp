<p>1. Following last yearâ€™s theft of 238 scripts of the 2017 GCE A-Level
H2 Chemistry Paper 3 in the United Kingdom, affected candidates were offered
the option of a re- examination of Paper 3 in either April or November
2018.</p>
<p>2. 57 candidates registered for the April 2018 re-examination. Of these,
36 candidates sat for the re-examination and were issued their results
today. The remaining 21 did not show up for the re-examination.</p>
<p>3. Three of the 36 candidates obtained an improved grade, and each will
receive an updated results slip and certificate. The majority of the other
candidates maintained their grades at the re-examination. As candidates
will be awarded the better of their two grades from the examinations, the
remaining 33 candidates will retain their previously awarded GCE A-Level
H2 Chemistry grade.</p>
<p>4. 18 candidates registered for the November 2018 re-examination of the
GCE A-Level H2 Chemistry Paper 3. These results will be released by February
2019. The 18 candidates will be sitting for the same paper as all other
candidates taking the 2018 H2 Chemistry Paper 3.</p>
