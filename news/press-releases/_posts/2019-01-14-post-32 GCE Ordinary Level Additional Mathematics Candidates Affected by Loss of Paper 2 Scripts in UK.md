<p>The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) has been informed
by Cambridge Assessment that 32 answer scripts for the 2018 GCE O-Level
Additional Mathematics’ Paper 2 were lost in the United Kingdom (UK).</p>
<p>2. The 32 scripts were from two secondary schools – 20 scripts from Nan
Hua High School and 12 scripts from Hong Kah Secondary School (12 scripts).</p>
<p>3. The incident occurred on 21 November 2018. A Cambridge examiner was
travelling by train from London to the north of England with the 32 scripts
in his luggage bag. The examiner’s bag was mistakenly taken by another
train passenger. Cambridge Assessment immediately launched an investigation
into the loss, and carried out extensive searches through the rail companies
and police to locate the examiner’s bag. Unfortunately, the scripts have
not been recovered and the search is still on-going.</p>
<p>4. Chief Executive of SEAB, Ms Tan Lay Choo, said, “We were upset and
disappointed when we heard the news from Cambridge Assessment, especially
since this happened so close to last year’s incident where 238 A-Level
H2 Chemistry scripts were stolen in the UK. Cambridge Assessment has expressed
its regret over the incident<sup>1</sup> and asked SEAB to convey its sincere
apologies to the affected candidates. Our priority now is to ensure that
the affected candidates are not disadvantaged by the incident, and that
they are given a valid and fair assessment for their Additional Mathematics
examination.”</p>
<h4><strong>Valid and Fair Assessment for Affected Candidates</strong></h4>
<p>5. In circumstances where a candidate does not have a mark for a paper,
Cambridge Assessment and SEAB have an established procedure to derive a
grade for the subject. The key consideration is to ensure that each affected
candidate is given a valid and fair assessment.</p>
<p>6. In this case, both Papers 1 and 2 of O-level Additional Mathematics
assess content from the whole syllabus, based on the same assessment objectives.
To award affected candidates a fair and valid grade, Cambridge Assessment
and SEAB took into consideration the 32 candidates’ performance in the
other Additional Mathematics paper<sup>2</sup>, which makes up 44% of the
final grade, relative to the entire cohort’s overall performance in the
subject. To check for consistency in the affected candidates’ overall performance
in Additional Mathematics, Cambridge Assessment and SEAB also considered
the candidates’ school preliminary examination results. It is important
to note that the derived final grade is not simply a rebasing of Paper
1 from 44% to 100%.</p>
<p>7. Following this procedure, about 91% (29 Candidates) of the affected
candidates obtained at least a Pass grade, with about 63% (20 candidates)
attaining distinctions, i.e. A1/A2. Almost all the affected candidates
had been awarded better or the same grades for the O-Level Additional Mathematics
as compared to their school preliminary examinations.</p>
<h4><strong>Offer of Re-examination of Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p>8. Similar to last year’s incident, Cambridge Assessment and SEAB will
offer affected candidates the option of a re-examination of the Additional
Mathematics Paper 2 on 15 February 2019. The results of the re-examination
will be released by end-February 2019. Details of the registration for
the re-examination have been provided by SEAB to the candidates on 14 January
2019, after they had received their result slips.</p>
<p>9. The re-examination of Additional Mathematics Paper 2 will be based
on the same curriculum that the candidates had been taught in schools.
The re-examination will be pegged at the same standard as the 2018 Additional
Mathematics Paper 2. The examination format will also remain unchanged.</p>
<p>10. For candidates who choose to sit for the re-examination, Cambridge
Assessment and SEAB will count the better of the two grades, i.e. the better
of the awarded grade and the re-examination grade, and this will be recorded
as the final grade in their GCE O-Level result slip and certificate.</p>
<p>11. For candidates who did not choose to sit for the re-examination, their
awarded grade will be recorded as the final grade in their GCE O-Level
result slip and certificate.</p>
<h4><strong>Facilitating Off-Cycle Posting</strong></h4>
<p>12. MOE and SEAB will also work with the junior colleges, Millennia Institute,
polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education to consider the candidates’
re- examination results for off-cycle posting to these institutions and
courses of study.</p>

<p><strong>32 candidates affected by missing scripts for Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Additional Mathematics Paper 2</strong>
</p>
<p>Cambridge Assessment has informed the Singapore Examinations and Assessment
Board (SEAB) that 32 scripts for the 2018 Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level
Additional Mathematics Paper 2 have been lost in the UK.</p>
<p>On 21 November 2018, a Cambridge examiner was travelling by train from
London to the north of England with the scripts in a luggage bag. The bag
containing the scripts was mistakenly taken by another train passenger
as it was almost identical to their own. Cambridge Assessment immediately
launched a major investigation to locate the examiner’s bag, carrying out
extensive searches through the relevant rail companies and the police.
The other passenger has not yet attempted to reclaim the bag, which was
left behind on the train, or returned the examiner’s bag. The search for
the examiner’s missing bag is ongoing. Cambridge Assessment sincerely regrets
this incident and any distress caused to candidates. Cambridge Assessment
will work with SEAB to make sure that the affected candidates receive a
fair and valid result.</p>
<p>The examiner involved in this incident has breached Cambridge Assessment’s
security policy for the transportation of scripts by leaving them unattended.
As a result, this examiner will not be engaged to mark scripts in the future.
Cambridge Assessment has also taken steps to remind all examiners of the
importance of keeping scripts secure whilst they are in their possession.</p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of Cambridge Assessment, Juliet Wilson, Director of
Assessment, said: “We apologise for this incident and for the distress
caused to candidates. We will work closely with SEAB to make sure that
affected candidates receive a fair and valid grade, and are not disadvantaged.
We are conducting a thorough review of our procedures relating to handling
of scripts."</p>
<p><strong>Valid and fair assessment of affected candidates</strong>
</p>
<p>Cambridge Assessment has a robust procedure in place for situations where
a candidate does not have a mark for one of the papers of an examined subject.
This procedure is designed to provide a valid and fair assessment of the
affected candidates while maintaining the integrity of the examination
itself. With the concurrence of SEAB, Cambridge Assessment has awarded
each candidate a grade based on the candidate’s performance in the other
Additional Mathematics paper and their cohort’s performance in Additional
Mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>Offer of re-examination</strong>
</p>
<p>Cambridge Assessment is also working closely with SEAB to offer affected
candidates the option of a re-examination of the O-Level Additional Mathematics
Paper 2 on 15 February 2019. The results will be released by the end of
February 2019. The re-examination of O-Level Additional Mathematics Paper
2 will assess the same curriculum as and be graded at the same standard
as the original 2018 O-Level Additional Mathematics Paper 2 examination.
For candidates who take up the re-examination, Cambridge Assessment and
SEAB will award the better of the two grades – i.e. the better of the assessed
grade and the re- examination grade. This will be recorded on their O-Level
results slip and certificate. For candidates who do not wish to take the
re-examination, the assessed grade will be recorded on their O-Level statement
of results and certificate.</p>
