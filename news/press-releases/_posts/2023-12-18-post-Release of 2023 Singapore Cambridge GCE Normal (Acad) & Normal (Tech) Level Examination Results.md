<p>1. Candidates who sat for the 2023 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate
of Education (GCE) Normal (Academic) [N(A)] and Normal (Technical) [N(T)]
Level Examinations received their results today<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>2. 9,153 candidates from the Secondary 4 N(A) course and 4,422 candidates
from the Secondary 4 N(T) course sat for the examinations. 9,094&nbsp;
(or 99.4%) candidates from the N(A) course have achieved Grade 5 or better
in at least one N(A) subject<sup>2</sup>, and 4,330 (or 97.9%) candidates
from the N(T) course have achieved Grade D or better in at least one N(T)
subject<sup>3</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. This year,&nbsp;49% of the school candidates from the N(A) course sat
for subjects in the GCE Ordinary Level (GCE O-Level) examinations. Schools
will take their combined GCE N(A)-Level and school-based O-Level preliminary
examination results into consideration when determining their eligibility
for progression to Secondary 5 N(A) or post-secondary pathways.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Progression to Secondary 5 Normal (Academic)</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;77.2% of the school candidates from the N(A) course are eligible
for progression to Secondary 5 N(A). These candidates must have obtained
an aggregate of 19 points or lower in English Language, Mathematics and
the best three subjects (ELMAB3), and at least a N(A)-Level Grade 5 for
all subjects used in the computation of the ELMAB3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Progression Pathways for Normal (Academic) Students</strong>
</p>
<p>5. Secondary 4 N(A) students who sat for the GCE N(A)-Level Examinations
in 2023 as school candidates, obtained a raw ELMAB3 aggregate of 19 points
or lower<sup>4</sup>, and met subject-specific entry requirements for their
chosen course will have the option of applying for the Direct-Entry-Scheme
to Polytechnic Programme (DPP).&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. The DPP prepares Secondary 4 N(A) students for progression into mapped
polytechnic diploma courses via a two-year Higher Nitec programme at the
Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Under the DPP, students who successfully
complete their <em>Higher Nitec</em> course and attain the minimum qualifying
Grade Point Average (GPA) are guaranteed a place in a polytechnic diploma
course mapped to their <em>Higher Nitec</em> course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. About 1,200 DPP places will be offered across all three ITE Colleges.
Applications for the DPP will open on 18 December 2023.&nbsp; For more
information, please refer to https://www.ite.edu.sg/admissions/full-time-courses/higher-nitec-dpp.</p>
<p>8. Secondary 4 N(A) students who sat for the GCE N(A)-Level Examinations
in 2023 as school candidates also have the option of applying for the Polytechnic
Foundation Programme (PFP). Students are eligible to apply for the PFP
if they have obtained a raw ELMAB3 aggregate of 12 points or lower, and
meet the subject-specific requirements for their chosen course. From the&nbsp;Academic
Year (AY) 2024 intake, the minimum subject grades for the two ‘Best’ subjects
will be relaxed from N(A)-Level Grade 3 to Grade 4<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>9. The PFP is a one-year foundation programme at the polytechnics that
offers a practice-oriented curriculum taught by polytechnic lecturers,
to prepare students for entry into the relevant polytechnic diploma courses.
Upon completion of the PFP, students will progress to their pre-selected
diploma course, subject to them passing all modules in the PFP.</p>
<p>10. The polytechnics will offer about 1,700 PFP places in total. Applications
for the PFP will open in January 2024, on the day of the GCE O-Level Examination
results release. Secondary 4 N(A) students who intend to apply for the
PFP should first progress to Secondary 5 on 2 January 2024. All PFP-bound
students are required to attend their Secondary 5N(A) classes in their
secondary schools up till the last Friday of January 2024, i.e. 26 January
2024. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>11. All N(A) course students who have completed their secondary education
may also apply to further their studies through ITE’s two-year <em>Nitec </em>or
three-year <em>Higher Nitec</em> programmes. For more information on courses

<p>12. All N(T) course students who complete their secondary education in
2023 may similarly apply to further their studies through ITE’s two-year <em>Nitec </em>or
three-year <em>Higher Nitec</em> programmes.</p>
<p>13. Schools may also laterally transfer Secondary 4 N(T) students to Secondary

and Grade B or better for one other subject at the GCE N(T)-Level Examination.</p>
