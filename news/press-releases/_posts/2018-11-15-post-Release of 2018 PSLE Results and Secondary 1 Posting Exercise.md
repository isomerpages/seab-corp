<p>1. The results of the 2018 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will
be released on Thursday, 22 November 2018. Students may obtain their results
from their respective primary schools from 11.00am on 22 November 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Submission of Secondary 1 Options</strong>
</p>
<p>2. Eligible students will receive option forms to select secondary schools
when they collect their results slips. Students should discuss their secondary
school choices with their parents before they complete the Secondary 1
(S1) Option Forms.</p>
<p>3. In every S1 Option Form, there will be a unique S1 Personal Identification
Number (S1 PIN) which can be found at the top right-hand corner of the
form. The S1 PIN can be used to submit the secondary school options online
via the Secondary 1 Internet System (S1-IS). The S1-IS will be accessible
from 11.00am on 22 November 2018 to 3.00pm on 28 November 2018 through
the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) website at www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/secondary-one-posting-exercise/submit-sch-choices.</p>
<p>4. Students, in discussion with their parents, should first consider their
secondary school choices, make their decision, and then complete the option
form before logging on to the S1-IS. This will help to facilitate the smooth
completion of their online submission.</p>
<p>5. Alternatively, the option form can be submitted through the student’s
primary school. Submission at primary schools can be made during the following
timeslots: 11.00am to 3.00pm on 22 November 2018, and 9.00am to 3.00pm
on 23, 26, 27 and 28 November 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>9. Specialised Schools for Normal (Technical) students (SSNTs) - Crest
Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School - offer an alternative educational
pathway for students eligible for the Normal (Technical) course, who have
an interest in practice- oriented, hands-on learning. The schools offer
a customised skills-based curriculum and exposure to authentic learning
opportunities, putting students in good stead for progression to the ITE.
The SSNTs also provide a whole-school environment that emphasises values,
socio-emotional learning and character-building - which in turn helps to
nurture more holistic and confident learners, ready for future challenges.</p>
<p>10. Students in the SSNTs will study GCE Normal (Technical)-Level English
Language, Mother Tongue Language and Mathematics. Selected students can
also take Science as an additional subject. As part of Subject-Based Banding,
eligible students can also take selected subjects at Normal (Academic)-Level.
In addition, Secondary 3 students will be able to specialise in two of
five skills subjects1 offered under the new ITE Skills Subject Certificate
(ISSC) from 2021. The ISSC will replace the ITE Skills Certificate (ISC),
providing a more broad-based curriculum that widens students’ exposure
to different industry growth areas.</p>
<p>11. Students who are eligible for the Normal (Technical) course and are
interested to study in Crest Secondary School or Spectra Secondary School
should apply directly to these schools from 11.00am on 22 November 2018
until 12.00pm on 26 November 2018. In addition, these students are also
required to indicate their choices for other secondary schools under the
S1 Posting Process. This will ensure that those who are not admitted into
Crest or Spectra can be posted to another school of their choice in a timely
and seamless manner.</p>
<p>12. Application forms for these two schools will be available from the
primary schools when students receive their results, or from the two schools’
websites (<a href="http://www.crestsec.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.crestsec.edu.sg</a> and
<a href="http://www.spectra.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.spectra.edu.sg</a>). Students successfully admitted into Crest
or Spectra will be informed by the schools via mail and SMS by 13 December
2018.</p>
<p>13. More information on Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School
can be found on the schools’ websites and the information booklet entitled
“Choosing Your Secondary Schools”.</p>
<p><strong><sup><sub>1 </sub></sup><sub>The five skills subjects are Mechanical Design &amp; Automation, Culinary &amp; Restaurant Operations, Retail &amp; e-Commerce, Internet of Things Applications and Mobile Web Applications.</sub></strong>
