<p>1. In line with the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) updates to the national
COVID-19 testing and isolation protocols, the Ministry of Education (MOE)
will be updating the precautionary measures currently implemented in primary
and secondary schools, Special Education (SPED) schools, junior colleges
(JCs)/ Millennia Institute (MI), as well as Institutes of Higher Learning
(IHLs). MOE and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB)
will also update the arrangements for the upcoming GCE-level national examinations.</p>
<p><strong>Updates to Precautionary Measures</strong>
</p>
<p>2. From 11 October 2021, MOH will issue 7-day Health Risk Warning to students
in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, in line with Protocol
3 of the 1-2-3 protocols<sup>1</sup>. Such students can return to school
during the 7 days if they continue to be well and have a negative Antigen
Rapid Test (ART) result before they leave for school daily. <strong>MOE will no longer issue Leave of Absence (LOA) and Approved Absence (AA) for primary schools, secondary schools (including SPED schools), JCs / MI</strong>.
This means students and staff currently under existing Quarantine Orders,
LOA or AA can return to school for lessons as long as they are well and
have a negative ART test result on the day they go to school. IHLs will
similarly take alignment with MOH’s revised protocols. This is in line
with the national approach to living with COVID-19.</p>
<p>3. An overview of the updated categories of precautionary measures in
schools and IHLs, is in Table 1.</p>

<p><strong>Updates to arrangements for GCE-Level National Examinations</strong>
</p>
<p>4. The national examinations are important milestones in a student’s educational
journey, and MOE and SEAB recognise candidates’ preference to have the
opportunity to take their national year-end examination where possible.
With the latest updates to the national COVID-19 isolation and testing
protocols, MOE and SEAB will update the examination arrangements for candidates
taking their upcoming GCE- Level national year-end examinations, starting
from 11 October.</p>
<p><em><u>Candidates issued MOH’s Health Risk Warning</u></em>
</p>
<p>5. Candidates on HRW who are well will be allowed to sit for their national
year- end examinations, including the science practical examinations, and
can take public transport to and from their examination venue. They should
meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>a. Inform schools of their intent to sit for their examinations;</p>
<p>b. Ensure that they meet MOH’s test protocol requirements, i.e.:</p>
<p>i. Testing negative for ART on the first day;</p>
<p>ii. Testing negative for ART on the day of their examinations, before
leaving their home;</p>
<p>c. Show a photo of their ART kits with negative test result<sup>2</sup> to
the invigilators.</p>
<p>6. Strict Safe Management Measures (SMMs) will be in place at the examination
venues for candidates on HRW. These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Being seated in separate rooms, venues or laboratory from other candidates;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3m spacing exam-style seating for the written examinations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><em><u>Candidates on Medical Leave</u></em>
</p>
<p>7. Candidates who are on medical leave will be allowed to sit for the
national year- end examinations if they have fully recovered<sup>3</sup>.
On the day of examination, they must take a self-swab ART at home and show
a photograph of their ART kits with negative result to the invigilators
on arrival.</p>
<p><strong>Arrangements for Candidates on Quarantine Order (QO)</strong>
</p>
<p>8. The remaining arrangements as well as prevailing SMMs implemented for
the national examinations that were earlier announced<sup>4 </sup>will
continue to be in place. An updated summary of the arrangements, taking
effect from 11 October, is in Table 2.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Special Consideration</strong>
</p>
<p>9. Similar to previous years, candidates who miss any national examination
paper(s) with valid reasons (including COVID-19 related, medical leave
or compassionate reasons) can apply for special consideration<sup>9</sup>.
Special consideration is a well-established procedure which awards candidates
with projected grades through a fair and rigorous evidence-based methodology.
In awarding a grade for these affected candidates, SEAB considers multiple
sources of data, such as the candidate’s performance in the other papers
for that affected subject in national and school-based examinations as
well as the school cohort's performance in national and school-based examinations,
to ensure a fair assessment for all candidates. All special consideration
applications are assessed on each case’s merit, to ensure that the grades
awarded are as accurate and fair as possible.</p>
<p>10. Schools will continue to maintain tight screening using temperature-taking,
observation and screening questions at the start of the school day to keep
school safe for all. MOE and SEAB will continue to monitor the COVID-19
situation and implement additional measures to keep our school environment
safe, where necessary. We urge all students and staff to continue practising
good personal hygiene, adhere to SMMs, and exercise social responsibility.</p>
