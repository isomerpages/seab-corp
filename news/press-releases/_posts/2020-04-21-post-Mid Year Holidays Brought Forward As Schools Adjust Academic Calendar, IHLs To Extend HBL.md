  Calendar, IHLs To Extend HBL

<p>1. Since the implementation of full Home-Based Learning (HBL) on 8 April
2020, our schools and educators have been working hard to ensure that students
are able to continue with meaningful learning and to provide greater support
to those who are not able to learn from home. Students have adapted to
learning from home and demonstrated resilience during this challenging
time. Parents have also learned how to guide their children, while giving
their children the space to learn for themselves and be more self-directed.
It has been a period of learning and growth for everyone. Educators, students
and parents have all risen admirably to the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>4-week School Holidays to begin on 5 May</strong>
</p>
<p>2. With the Multi-Ministry Taskforce’s decision to extend the Circuit
Breaker (CB) period till 1 June 2020, the Ministry of Education (MOE) will
bring forward the June holidays to 5 May 2020. While HBL has been going
well, it has been an intense period of hard work and adjustment for parents,
students and teachers. An early June holiday will give everyone a respite.
It also buys us time for a less restrictive school opening in June.</p>
<p>3. With the school holidays brought forward, lessons will resume on 2
June 2020 (more details on the format of these lessons – physical classes,
partial HBL or full HBL – will be released at a later date depending on
the national posture at that time). This means that Term 3 will now be
longer, but we will institute a one-week mid-term break from 20 to 26 July
2020. These adjustments will apply to all MOE Kindergartens, primary, secondary
and Pre-University students, including students from Special Education
(SPED) schools. The revised academic calendar is as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>5 May 2020 to 1 June 2020:</strong> School holidays</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2 June 2020:</strong> Start of Term 3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>20 July 2020 to 26 July 2020:</strong> Mid-term break</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>6 September 2020:</strong> End of Term 3</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to extend HBL</strong>
</p>
<p>4. The IHLs will take the following approach from 5 May 2020 to 1 June
2020:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students from polytechnics will continue with full HBL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) will continue
with full HBL until 8 May 2020. Thereafter, they will be on vacation from
9 May to 1 June. The vacation is brought forward from mid-June. ITE will
be providing more details separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students from the Singapore Institute of Technology and some students
from the Singapore University of Technology and Design will be starting
their school term on 18 May 2020 in full HBL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other Autonomous Universities will be having their holidays. Those
offering a summer term will conduct all classes online</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limited Care Services to continue in Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>5. Parents working in essential services like healthcare and who are also
unable to secure alternative care arrangements, may continue to approach
their children’s primary school, MOE Kindergarten or SPED school for assistance
during the school holidays. These support services have been ongoing throughout
the HBL period, and will continue to be offered. Private education institutions
should either continue with their HBL arrangements, or suspend classes
otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Rescheduling of GCE-Level MTL Examinations</strong>
</p>
<p>6. In view of the changes to the academic calendar, the Singapore Examinations
and Assessment Board (SEAB) will reschedule the Mid-Year Mother Tongue
Language (MTL) Written Examinations as follows:</p>

<p>7. Taking into consideration the Term 3 mid-term break from 20 July to
26 July, the listening comprehension for O- and A-level MTL and MTL B will
be rescheduled as follows:</p>

<p>8. About 20,600 students across all schools have registered for the O-
and A-Level MTL Mid-Year examinations. SEAB will work with schools to put
in place precautionary measures to protect the safety and well-being of
students and examination personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Removal of Common Last Topics</strong>
</p>
<p>9. In light of the impact that the extended CB period has on curriculum
time and to further allay students’ concerns and anxiety about catching
up with the curriculum, the Common Last Topics (CLT) will be removed from
the national examinations this year. The CLT is a set of topics from a
syllabus identified by MOE that would be taught last by all schools towards
the end of the academic year. Examples of CLT to be removed include “Interactions
within the Environment” for PSLE Science, Vectors for O-level Mathematics
and “Introduction to the Chemistry of Transition Elements” for A-level
H2 Chemistry. The CLT provides MOE and SEAB with the flexibility of reducing
the scope covered in national examinations should an unforeseen situation
occur that does not allow schools to complete their teaching for the graduating
cohorts. The CLT will still be taught, but not be examinable.</p>
<p>10. For skill-based subjects such as English Language and MTL, it will
not be meaningful and practical to identify CLTs. In such instances, SEAB
will take the disruption to curriculum time into consideration during marking
and grading to ensure that all students are fairly assessed.</p>
<p>11. Even with the adjustments to national examinations, MOE recognises
that students in graduating cohorts will continue to face some anxiety.
We will look to phase in more consultations for these students, and explore
more face-to-face lessons, when the national situation improves.</p>
<p>12. For non-graduating students, similar measures will be adopted at the
school level to help students cope with the reduced curriculum time and
the demand of the year-end school-based examinations. MOE will provide
further guidance to schools in due course on how such adjustments can be
made.</p>
<p>13. MOE will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and provide
the necessary support to our schools, educators and students. Parents are
strongly encouraged to keep their children at home during this period.</p>
