results in their respective classrooms. Only school candidates collecting
their results were allowed entry into the school premises, with Safe Management
Measures (SMMs) in place. Private candidates will be notified of their
individual result by post as per previous years. All candidates are also
able to access their results online via the Singapore Examinations and
Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates Portal at <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>www.seab.gov.sg</u></a>.</p>
