<br>Dear Editor</p>
<p><strong>MEASURES IN PLACE TO SAFEGUARD STUDENT WELL-BEING AFTER RELAXING OF MASK RULES</strong>
</p>
<p>We thank Ms Teo Leng Lee, Ms Khoo Yik Lin and Mr Alex Yeo for their feedback
and suggestions related to mask-wearing in schools (Wait until national
exams in schools are over to relax mask rules; P6 cohort has been through
a lot already, both Aug 24; and With masks now optional, what other protective
measures are in place? Aug 25).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past two years, while mask-wearing has served a key purpose of
minimising the risk of disease transmission, it has posed challenges to
teaching and learning in schools. As Singapore becomes more Covid-19-resilient
due to high vaccination and booster rates, as well as safe recovery from
infections, the legal requirement for mask-wearing in indoor settings has
been removed from Aug 29.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In tandem with the national posture, students and teachers now also have
the option of unmasking indoors. This will provide opportunities to support
students' learning and developmental needs, and allow them to communicate
and build bonds with one another with greater ease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we note the concerns raised by the writers over the safety
and well-being of students, and would like to assure them that these remain
our priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students and teachers who prefer to continue wearing masks in school may
do so, including for the national examinations. To minimise the risk of
school-based transmissions prior to the Primary School Leaving Examination,
Primary 6 pupils will go on a study break from Sept 26 to 28, similar to
the past two years' practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schools will also continue to employ measures to ensure a safe school
and examination environment, including wiping down high-touch surfaces
and conducting visual screening of students' well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we have learnt from our experience with Covid-19 thus far, exercising
personal and social responsibility is key in keeping the school community
safe.</p>
<p>Those who are unwell are advised to follow the Ministry of Health's protocols
to self-isolate and to see a doctor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Candidates sitting the national examinations who are absent with valid
reasons for any paper can apply for special consideration. All such applications
are reviewed on each case's merit, and will be subject to a rigorous review
process to ensure that candidates are assessed and awarded a grade fairly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage all students and teachers to continue to stay vigilant, practise
good personal hygiene and seek medical attention if they are unwell.
