<p><strong>ROBUST PROCESS TO ENSURE PSLE CHINESE LANGUAGE EXAMS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS </strong>
</p>
<p>We would like to thank Ms Chen Han for her feedback (“Primary School Leaving
Examination (PSLE) Chinese Language comprehension questions are beyond
students' cognitive level”, 14 July 2025).</p>
<p>The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board has a robust process in
place to ensure examinations assess students fairly and accurately, and
is made accessible to all candidates. The choice of passages and questions
follows the standards and requirements of the Ministry of Education’s Chinese
Language syllabus, which places emphasis on developing students' 21st Century
Competencies (respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity, care, and
harmony), along with relevant language knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>The passage in the 2024 PSLE Chinese Language Paper 2 is a fable about
a baby kangaroo and its family, that explores the themes of communication,
understanding, mutual love and respect. The questions are designed to be
aligned with learning objectives and requirements of reading comprehension
outlined in the primary school Chinese Language syllabus, and is within
the grasp of a Primary 6 student.</p>
<p>Regarding the specific comprehension question that Ms Chen referred to
in her letter - "What kind of child is the baby kangaroo? How do you know?"
- students are only required to understand the information provided in
the passage and respond from their perspective about the baby Kangaroo’s
character traits , using information from the passage to support their
answer. &nbsp;Any reasonable answer would be credited.</p>
