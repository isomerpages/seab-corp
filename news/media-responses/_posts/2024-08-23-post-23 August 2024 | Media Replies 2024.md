<h4><strong>23 August 2024</strong></h4>
<p><strong>ROBUST PROCESSES ENSURE ACCESSIBILITY OF PSLE ORAL EXAM TOPICS IS COMPARABLE ACROSS DAYS</strong>
</p>
<p>We thank Ms Jenny Tan for her views in her letter (“Different PSLE oral
exam topics may affect how well pupils do” (August 19).</p>
<p>There are robust processes in place to ensure that the accessibility of
topics tested for the PSLE English and Mother Tongue Language oral examinations
is comparable across different days.</p>
<p>The panel involved in the development of the PSLE consists of experienced
educators and curriculum specialists from the Ministry of Education, as
well as assessment specialists from the Singapore Examinations and Assessment
Board. They are familiar with the examination syllabuses and the teaching
and learning in schools.</p>
<p>The oral exam topics, such as outdoor activities, healthy diet, reading
and showing care for the elderly, take into consideration the general experiences
of primary school pupils.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should pupils require support during the conversations, the oral examiners
will provide additional prompts.</p>
<p>We would like to assure that pupils are not required to have deep knowledge
of the topics assessed. They are assessed on their overall ability to converse
with the oral examiners using appropriate vocabulary, sentence structures
and expression.</p>
