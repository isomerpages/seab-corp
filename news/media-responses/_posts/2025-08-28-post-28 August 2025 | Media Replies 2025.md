<p><strong>PSLE ORAL EXAMINATION TOPICS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS AND HAVE STANDARDISED DIFFICULTY LEVELS</strong>
</p>
<p>We would like to thank 杨炀 (“The reality behind an oral exam question”,
21 August 2025) and 王芳 (“Disparity in difficulty between oral exam topics
over two days”, 21 August 2025) for their feedback.</p>
<p>The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) has rigorous processes
in place for developing national examinations. This includes the oral examinations
where the topics and questions are set to be comparable in difficulty across
different days.</p>
<p>The panel responsible for developing the PSLE papers comprises experienced
teachers, curriculum specialists from the Ministry of Education, and assessment
specialists from SEAB. The panel ensures that the examination questions
are aligned with the teaching syllabus. For example, the PSLE Chinese Language
topic for Day 2 mentioned in王芳’s letter is aligned to the curriculum; the
topics tested (e.g. local attractions such as the zoo, and the botanical
gardens, as well as overseas travel) were featured in the students’ textbooks.
The panel also ensures that the oral topics take into consideration the
experiences of students. For example, the PSLE English Language oral topic
for Day 1 on queueing and orderliness are common occurrences that students
experience in daily life and are topics that they can talk about.</p>
<p>In the PSLE oral examinations, students are assessed on their ability
to converse with the oral examiners using appropriate vocabulary, sentence
structures and good pronunciation, and not on their knowledge of specific
content. As a principle, the oral topics and related prompts are set in
a manner that provides students with a wide scope to respond, based on
their perspectives. Should students require support during the conversations,
the oral examiners will provide additional prompts and students will not
be penalised.</p>
