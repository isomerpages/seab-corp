<p>Please contact SEAB if you have not received your notification via registered
mail or email by 30 September 2022.</p>
<h4><strong>Subject Amendments</strong></h4>
<p>You can amend your registered subjects via the&nbsp; Candidates Portal.
For registrations made during the supplementary registration exercise,
you may amend the subjects / papers that you have registered for without
any fee, if you have&nbsp;not&nbsp;paid your examination fees online and
if the amendments are made&nbsp;before&nbsp;the end of the registration
period.</p>
<p>Should there be amendments to your registered subjects / papers after
payment has been made or after the registration deadline of&nbsp;17 May
2022, 11:59 pm, you will need to pay a one-time amendment fee of $20 per
amendment request. This is in addition to the fee for each of your added
subjects. All fees are inclusive of 7% GST. You will receive a 50% refund
of subject fees for any subjects that you have removed.
