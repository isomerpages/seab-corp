<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
<br>Mr Don Wee, Chua Chu Kang GRC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider removing
the annotation symbol from the PSLE certificates of those candidates who
have been granted access arrangements during the PSLE such as extra time
allowance.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
<br>1. Examinations are meant to certify the academic achievements of candidates
and are administered under a set of standardised conditions. This is to
ensure a fair examination and that examination results can be compared
meaningfully across candidates.</p>
<p>2. For students with Special Educational Needs or medical conditions,
standardised testing conditions may result in them being given an inadequate
assessment of their abilities or being unable to take the examinations
altogether. To cater to these candidates, the Singapore Examinations and
Assessment Board (SEAB) provides access arrangements, which may range from
exemption from specific components of the examination and provision of
extra time, to provision of a separate room or enlarged print.
<br>
<br>3. When access arrangements have been granted, SEAB’s policy is to annotate
on the examination certificate only when there are significant modifications
of the examination. This is done to indicate factually that the candidate
has taken the examination under conditions that are different from the
standard prescribed conditions, and to uphold the integrity and fairness
of the examination.
<br>
<br>4. A student’s progression to secondary education will not be affected
by the annotation, as school postings do not take such annotations into
account.</p>
