<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
<br>Mr Christopher de Souza, Holland-Bukit Timah GRC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education (a) whether provisions can be made for
candidates to resit the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) when
they have a medical certificate which deems them medically unfit to sit
for the examination ; and&nbsp;(b) whether this can be done without retaining
the student for another year.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Candidates who have been certified to be medically unfit to sit for the
PSLE will not need to resit the examination as there are methods which
allow us to assess the studentsâ€™ attainment levels.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Candidates who are absent from a subject at the PSLE with&nbsp; valid&nbsp;reason(s)
will be given a projected T-score for the subject. The projected T-score
takes into consideration the candidate's performance in that subject in
school, his/her peers' performance in the subject in school and national
examinations.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the candidate is absent for the entire PSLE, a PSLE aggregate score
would similarly be projected for the candidate using the same approach.&nbsp;
He/she will not be required to resit the PSLE.</p>
</li>
</ol>
