<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Minister for Education (a) what percentage of questions in
the 2025 PSLE papers for each of the four main subjects were classified
as challenging questions; (b) whether such questions require application
of knowledge beyond the school syllabus; and (c) what measures the Ministry
has in place to ensure that students who cannot afford private tuition
are not disadvantaged by such examination questions.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The PSLE contains questions of varying difficulty levels to allow students
with different abilities to demonstrate their understanding. Challenging
questions make up approximately 15% of total marks in each subject.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All questions, including challenging ones, are based entirely on the primary
school syllabus and do not require knowledge beyond the curriculum. However,
challenging questions do require students to apply the concepts in novel
or authentic contexts.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure accessibility, all questions use age-appropriate language and
contexts.&nbsp; In addition, challenging questions are often structured
with scaffolding to help students attempt them progressively.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These measures help to ensure that the PSLE remains accessible to all
students, including those without private tuition.</p>
