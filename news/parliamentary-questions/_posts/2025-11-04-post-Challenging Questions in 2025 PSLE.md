<p><strong>Notice Paper No. 131</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>PQ *612 for Oral Answer</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>For the sitting on or after 15 October 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song: </strong>To ask the Minister for Education
(a) what percentage of questions in the 2025 PSLE papers for each of the
four main subjects were classified as challenging questions; (b) whether
such questions require application of knowledge beyond the school syllabus;
and (c) what measures the Ministry has in place to ensure that students
who cannot afford private tuition are not disadvantaged by such examination
questions.</p>
<p><strong><u>Response</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The PSLE contains questions of varying difficulty levels to allow students
with different abilities to demonstrate their understanding. Challenging
questions make up approximately 15% of total marks in each subject.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All questions, including challenging ones, are based entirely on the primary
school syllabus and do not require knowledge beyond the curriculum. However,
challenging questions do require students to apply the concepts in novel
or authentic contexts.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To ensure accessibility, all questions use age-appropriate language and
contexts.&nbsp; In addition, challenging questions are often structured
with scaffolding to help students attempt them progressively.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These measures help to ensure that the PSLE remains accessible to all students,
including those without private tuition.</p>
