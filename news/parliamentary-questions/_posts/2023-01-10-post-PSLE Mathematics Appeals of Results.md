<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education (a) how many appeals were received after
the 2022 PSLE results were released for the Mathematics paper; and (b)
how many were successful in their appeal and had their scores adjusted
to a better grade.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
<br>1.&nbsp;About 1.5% of the 2022 PSLE cohort appealed to review their results
for the Mathematics subject.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;A thorough check of the marking and accuracy of mark entries was
conducted by independent senior markers for all students who had appealed
for a review of their PSLE grades. One student had a change in grade in
PSLE Mathematics. The rest were in order.</p>
