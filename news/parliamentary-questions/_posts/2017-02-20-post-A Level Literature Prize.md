<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
<br>Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry, Nee Soon GRC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education (Schools) in view of Cambridge International
Examinations' discontinuation of the Angus Ross Prize for English literature,
whether the Ministry can set up (i) an equivalent A-level literature prize
for Singapore and (ii) corresponding A-level literature prizes for mother
tongue languages of Malay, Chinese and Tamil.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE<br></strong>The achievements of Singaporean students
in the Angus Ross Prize was an additional testimony to the performance
of our Literature students. The discontinuation of the Prize is unlikely
to have a significant impact on our students’ interest in studying Literature
at 'A' Level. This motivation is more associated with our students’ passion
for the subject and efforts by our Literature teachers to make the subject
come alive for students.</p>
<p>MOE does not award a top academic award for any individual subject, and
it is not necessary to start doing so now. While quality performance in
examinations remains important, it is more important for us to emphasise
the quality of our students’ learning experience throughout the entire
'A’ Level course.</p>
