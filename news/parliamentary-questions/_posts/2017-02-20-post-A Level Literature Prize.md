<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry, Nee Soon GRC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
</p>
<p>To ask the Minister for Education (Schools) in view of Cambridge International
Examinations' discontinuation of the Angus Ross Prize for English literature,
whether the Ministry can set up (i) an equivalent A-level literature prize
for Singapore and (ii) corresponding A-level literature prizes for mother
tongue languages of Malay, Chinese and Tamil.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
</p>
<p>The achievements of Singaporean students in the Angus Ross Prize was an
additional testimony to the performance of our Literature students. The
discontinuation of the Prize is unlikely to have a significant impact on
our students’ interest in studying Literature at 'A' Level. This motivation
is more associated with our students’ passion for the subject and efforts
by our Literature teachers to make the subject come alive for students.</p>
<p>MOE does not award a top academic award for any individual subject, and
it is not necessary to start doing so now. While quality performance in
examinations remains important, it is more important for us to emphasise
the quality of our students’ learning experience throughout the entire
'A’ Level course.</p>
