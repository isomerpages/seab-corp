<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
<br>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan, West Coast GRC
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education whether he can provide an update on
the ‘errata’ during the recent GCE A-level chemistry examination where
there were differing practices across institutions such that certain schools
were given extra time from 5 to 15 minutes to check and correct whilst
others not given additional time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
<br>1. In the 2022 GCE A-Level H2 Chemistry paper 3, an erratum to one of
the optional questions, affecting two sub-parts, worth one mark each, was
issued together with the Question Paper to every student at the start of
the examination.</p>
<p>2. During the examination, a few schools sought additional clarifications
on the erratum with the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB).
SEAB issued the clarifications to the erratum and advised schools to give
make-up time according to the duration of the announcement of the clarification.
This would ensure that students continue to have the full duration of two
hours to complete the paper.</p>
<p>3. Cambridge Assessment and SEAB will take this incident into consideration
during marking and ensure that students are not disadvantaged. SEAB will
also review the management of erratum to avoid such incidents in future.</p>
