<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong> 
<br>Mr Darryl David, Ang Mo Kio GRC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong> 
<br>To ask the Minister for Education (a) what is the number of students who
either could not take the 2021 Primary School Leaving Exams (PSLE) or had
to take their PSLE in special circumstances due to the COVID-19 situation;
and (b) how does the Ministry ensure that the grades allocated to students
who could not take their exams is a fair and appropriate one.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong> 
<br>1. 39,281 students registered for the 2021 PSLE written examinations that
were held from 30 September 2021 to 6 October 2021. The overall attendance
rate was 99.5%. About 430 (1.1%) students missed at least one paper due
to COVID-19 related reasons.</p>
<p>2. About 840 (2.1%) students who were on Quarantine Orders (QO) sat for
the examinations under special arrangement as they had tested negative
for COVID-19 in accordance with MOH's requirements. Of these, about 690
students (about 82%) managed to sit for all written papers.</p>
<p>3. Similar to previous years, students who miss any national examination
paper(s) with valid reasons (including COVID-19, medical leave or compassionate
reasons) can apply for special consideration. Special consideration is
a well-established procedure, used by many international examination boards,
which awards students with projected grades through a fair and rigorous
evidence-based methodology. In awarding a grade for these affected students,
SEAB will consider multiple sources of data, such as the student's performance
in the other papers for that affected subject in national and school-based
examinations as well as the school cohort's performance in national and
school-based examinations, to ensure a fair assessment for all students.
All special consideration applications are assessed on each case's merit,
to ensure that the grades awarded are as accurate and fair as possible.</p>
