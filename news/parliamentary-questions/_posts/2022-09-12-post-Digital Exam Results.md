<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT<br></strong>Mr Don
Wee, Chua Chu Kang GRC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education with the shift to focusing on skillsets
and other updated types of certifications, what are the reasons for listing
GCE "O" Level grades in the Singpass app.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
<br>1. Some 12,000 individuals request a statement of their results from the
Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board every year, mostly for their
GCE O-level results. This is for job applications or admissions to education
institutions. With the launch of this digital service, individuals with
Singpass would be able to retrieve and share these digital certificates
from their Skills Passports in MySkillsFuture accounts. This provides customer
convenience and raises administrative efficiency at the agencies.</p>
