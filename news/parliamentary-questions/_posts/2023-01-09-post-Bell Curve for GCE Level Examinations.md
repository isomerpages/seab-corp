<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
<br>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan, West Coast GRC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION<br></strong>To ask the Minister for Education whether
there is a bell curve for the GCE O and A level examinations for all subjects
to determine the final grade given.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
<br>1. Our national examinations do not grade to a bell curve, but are what
assessment experts describe as standards-referenced. The grades awarded
reflect a candidate’s level of mastery in a subject based on an absolute
set of standards. They are not affected by the performance of others.</p>
<p>2. Statistically, test scores of a large population of students in any
subject tend to fall into a normal distribution (a bell curve) due to natural
variation in the level of mastery among the students.</p>
<p>3. The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) ensures that
examination standards are comparable year on year. This means that each
examination is aligned with the syllabus objectives and learning outcomes,
and consists of a balanced proportion of basic, average and challenging
questions to cater to students of different abilities. This proportion
is kept stable year-on-year.</p>
<p>4. SEAB neither ‘force fits’ the exam scores of students into a bell curve
nor uses pre-determined proportions for grades. &nbsp;If there are more
candidates demonstrating better quality work in an examination year, a
higher percentage of them will be awarded better grades.</p>
