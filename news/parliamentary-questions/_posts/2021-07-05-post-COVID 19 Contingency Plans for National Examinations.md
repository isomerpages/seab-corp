<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
<br>Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, Potong Pasir SMC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education whether the Ministry has contingency
plans in the event that tightened COVID-19 measures are required when national
examinations are about to start or are ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
<br>1. National examinations are important milestones that affect students'
educational progression. The Ministry of Education and the Singapore Examinations
and Assessment Board are monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely and
contingency plans to manage potential disruptions are in place.</p>
<p>2. To ensure the well-being and safety of candidates and examination personnel
in the examination centres, Safe Management Measures and examination arrangements,
similar to those adopted in 2020 national examinations, would be implemented
for this year's national examinations. Students who are tested positive
for COVID-19, or who have been issued a Quarantine Order, Stay Home Notice,
or given a Leave Of Absence due to close contact with confirmed COVID-19
case(s) would not be allowed to sit for examinations.</p>
<p>3. Students who miss the national examinations due to COVID-19 related
reasons can apply for special consideration. All special consideration
applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis and subjected to a rigorous
review process.</p>
<p>4. Timely updates will be disseminated to schools, parents and candidates
should there be any changes to the examination arrangements.</p>
