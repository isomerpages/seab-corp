<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
<br>Ms Chia Yong Yong, Nominated Member of Parliament</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what
is the rationale for annotating examination certificates to indicate that
examination accommodation has been given; (b) whether he can assure the
House that such annotation will not result in discrimination against the
student in future studies and/or future employment; and (c)&nbsp;whether
it is now time to remove such annotations.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To cater to students with Special Educational Needs, long-term or temporary
medical conditions, the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB)
extend access arrangements, which may range from exemption from specific
components of the examination and provision of extra time to provision
of a separate room or enlarged print. For such students, standardised testing
conditions may result in them being unable to take the examinations altogether,
or if they can, an incomplete or inadequate assessment of their abilities.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examinations are meant to certify academic achievements of candidates.
From an examiners’ point of view, a key principle is to ensure that results
are fair. Therefore, in any standardised examination, it is expected that
the testing conditions would be similarly standardised to ensure fairness
of the results. When access arrangements have been granted,&nbsp; annotation&nbsp;may
be done to indicate factually that the candidate has taken the examination
under conditions that are different from the standard prescribed conditions.
This is to uphold the integrity of the system.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Singapore, SEAB’s policy is to annotate only where there are significant
modifications of the examination, such as exemption from specific components
and provision of extra time to complete the examination. Annotation is
neither intended to indicate a disability nor to discriminate against the
candidate. Our approach is similar to the practices of overseas examination
boards such as in Hong Kong and the US.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When our autonomous universities, polytechnics and the Institute of Technical
Education (ITE) consider admission applications, they do not take into
consideration the annotation of access arrangements in the certificates
of the students during the admissions process. Employers are also expected
to abide by the principles of fair and&nbsp;responsible employment set
out by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair
&amp; Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP).
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the candidates concerned,&nbsp; according&nbsp;flexibility of access
arrangements benefits deserving candidates, as it enables them to still
sit for the examination and have their abilities adequately assessed. To
the larger candidate population, annotation serves to ensure transparency
and fairness. While annotation indicates the non-standardised conditions
- without any details - it may also positively suggest that these candidates
have overcome challenges to achieve the results. At the same time, annotation
discourages non-deserving cases from unfairly securing access arrangements,
as the assessment of whether to extend this flexibility is not always straightforward.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Ministry has not come across cases of discriminatory hiring due to
annotations of access arrangement given. But we will continue to work with
the PSEIs and community agencies, such as SG Enable, to monitor feedback
from graduates.</p>
