<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
<br>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim, Sengkang GRC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education whether students taking national exams
such as the PSLE and "O/N/A" levels and who are served a Quarantine Order
or Stay-Home Notice will be permitted to undertake their exams in a centralised,
dedicated quarantine facility instead of being prohibited from taking the
exams altogether.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
<br>1. The Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Singapore Examinations and
Assessment Board (SEAB) have announced the updated arrangements on 26 September
2021 for those who may be affected by COVID-19 for the coming national
examinations. These include special arrangements to allow students to take
their national year-end examinations while on Quarantine Order (QO), Leave
of Absence or Approved Absence in a safe manner, starting from the PSLE
which began on 30 September 2021, and for GCE N(A)/N(T), O and A level
examinations thereafter.</p>
<p>2. Students on QO will be allowed to sit for national written examinations
under stringent conditions including a rigorous testing regime and safe
management measures. These includes a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) entry swab at the beginning of the QO, and students completing a
self-swab with Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) kits at home and test Ag- within
24 hours before each of their examination papers. Safe Management Measures
and other precautions are also put in place at the examination venues to
ensure the safe conduct of the national examinations.</p>
<p>3. In the immediate period before the national examinations, travelling
should be avoided. In addition, Stay-Home Notice (SHN) is mandatory for
persons after returning from overseas trips. SEAB will, however, make an
exception if a student needs to travel for compassionate reasons (e.g.
demise of close relatives). For these candidates on SHN, SEAB will apply
similar arrangements as that for candidates on QO to allow them to sit
for their national written examinations.</p>
