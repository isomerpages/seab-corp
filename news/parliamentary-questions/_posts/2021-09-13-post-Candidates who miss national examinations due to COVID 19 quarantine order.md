<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
<br>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song, Aljunied GRC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education for candidates who miss national examinations
because they are under a quarantine order (a) what evidence will be used
to award their grades; (b) how is a fair grade arrived at since some students
may not perform well during earlier school tests/examinations; (c) whether
an alternative examination script can be administered on another date;
and (d) how can parents be assured that they need not be anxious about
their children having contact with infected persons in the weeks leading
up to national examinations.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
<br>1. To enable as many students as possible to sit for the national examinations
while ensuring that the examinations are conducted safely with stringent
Safe Management Measures in place, the Ministry of Education and the Singapore
Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) have updated the examination arrangements
to include the use of Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) and Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) for students who are placed on Leave of Absence (LOA), Approved Absence,
on Medical Leave with Acute Respiratory Infection or Medical Leave due
to fever. Similar to last year's practice, schools will be implementing
a study break for graduating cohorts prior to the year-end national examinations
to minimise the risk of school-based transmissions and reduce the number
of students placed on QO and LOA.</p>
<p>2. Each year, there will be students who miss some papers of a subject
or sat for a paper under adverse circumstances at the national examinations,
such as an illness. Under such circumstances, schools will apply special
consideration for these students. Similarly, students who are affected
by COVID-19 can apply for special consideration.</p>
<p>3. Special consideration is a well-established procedure, used by many
international examination boards, to project grades through an evidence-based
and data-driven approach. To ensure that the projected grade is fair and
accurate, multiple sources of evidence are considered which include the
student's performance in the other papers for that affected subject in
national and school-based examinations as well as the school cohort's performance
in national and school-based examinations.
<br>
<br>4. While there is a make-up examination for oral examinations as these
are held well ahead of the year-end written examinations, there will be
no make-up examinations for the other papers held in the later part of
the year. Given the large number of written papers, providing make-up examinations
for these would lengthen the duration of national examinations and impact
downstream processes such as marking, results release and posting to schools.
<br>
<br>5. MOE and SEAB will monitor the COVID-19 situation and provide timely
updates if there are further changes to the examination arrangements.</p>
