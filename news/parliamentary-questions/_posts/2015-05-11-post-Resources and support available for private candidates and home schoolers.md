<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
<br>Professor Tan Tai Yong, Nominated Member of Parliament</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education (a) whether there are avenues for private
"O" level candidates to interact with students and make use of the facilities
such as laboratories and sports equipment in mainstream schools; (b) whether
the Ministry can consider a structured programme for these private candidates
to participate as CCA members outside of the formal curriculum; and (c)
whether the same sort of integration can be done for primary school children
who are home-schooled.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
<br>The profile of Singaporean private ‘O’ Level candidates is quite varied,
but they may be broadly grouped&nbsp; as:&nbsp;(i) those for whom enrolment
in a mainstream school would not be educationally meaningful or age-appropriate;
and (ii) those who voluntarily opt out of our mainstream school system.</p>
<p>The first group of private ‘O’ level candidates includes adult learners
studying one or two subjects on a part-time basis. It also includes students
who had completed their secondary school education, are more than four
years above secondary school age, or are already eligible for progression
to a post-secondary educational institution to further their education
but nevertheless had chosen to repeat specific “O” Level subjects as private
candidates.</p>
<p>Co-curricular activities (CCAs) are part of the school curriculum and
the holistic education of students in mainstream schools, tailored to the
students’ age profiles and conducted under the supervision of their teachers
who exercise a duty of care towards them. For private candidates who are
much older than the secondary school age, interaction with secondary school
age students and participation in our schools’ CCAs would not be age-appropriate.
It is also not easy to accommodate their other work or post-secondary education
commitments. Instead, there are many community groups that these private
candidates can join to interact with their community and to learn life
skills, such as those in the community clubs.</p>
<p>Similarly, science laboratories contain potentially hazardous equipment
and materials and are not suitable for unsupervised use. Students who take
their ‘O’ Levels at the Institute of Technical Education under the General
Education Programme will have supervised access to science laboratories
in selected&nbsp; schools,&nbsp;if they offer Science subjects.</p>
<p>Sports facilities in schools, which are more suitable for unsupervised
shared use, are already shared with the community outside school hours
under a partnership between MOE, Sports Singapore and People’s Association.</p>
<p>The second group of private ‘O’ level candidates include students in private
schools. For this small number of students in private schools, their schools
are expected to provide appropriate facilities and educational programmes
for them.</p>
<p>As for primary school children who are home-schooled, these students have
specifically applied to be exempted from enrolment in mainstream schools.
If they wish to benefit from the facilities and programmes in our mainstream
schools, the Ministry will facilitate their entry as a student into our
mainstream schools. It remains the Government’s preference that all Singaporean
children attend mainstream schools so that they grow up together with a
common educational experience.</p>
