<p><strong>NAME AND CONSTITUENCY OF MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>Ms Joan Pereira, Tanjong Pagar GRC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>To ask the Minister for Education in respect of national examinations
which are conducted in schools (a) whether examiners are trained on the
quantitative and objective criteria to make decisions during the examinations
such as considering a request to replay the audio tracks for a listening
comprehension examination; and (b) under what conditions are examination
personnel permitted to make decisions based on subjective criteria.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE</strong>
<br>1. Prior to the conduct of the national examinations, examination personnel
are briefed on the Standard Operating Procedures relating to the preparation
and conduct of the examinations, including procedures to deal with various
scenarios such as late arrival of candidates due to train disruptions,
unclear audio broadcast during the Listening examinations.</p>
<p>2. In complicated or unusual situations, examination personnel consult
SEAB on the measures to be taken. This is to ensure that the examinations
are conducted fairly for all candidates.</p>
<p>3. For Listening examinations, SEAB has put in protocols to handle disruptions,
such as environmental noise from movement of heavy vehicles, flypasts,
or muffled playback from the speakers. For such disruptions, the examination
personnel are allowed to replay the affected tracks to ensure fair assessment
for affected students.</p>
<p>4. In the recent incident from the 2024 GCE O-level English Language Listening
examination, five centres (out of 140 examination centres) reported having
to replay part of the audio tracks in one to two of their classrooms due
to environmental noise or muffled playback from the speakers. The assessment
format required tracks 2 to 6 to be played twice. Therefore, in the case
of a replay, the affected tracks would be replayed after all tracks have
been played and according to the examination format.</p>
