<p>As part of SEAB's commitment to robust governance, the SEAB Governing
Board is regularly renewed. With effect from 1 April 2025, three esteemed
members— Professor Bernard Tan, Ms Juthika Ramanathan and Mr Chin Chi Leong—
have completed their terms of service.</p>
<p>Professor Tan's twelve-year tenure with SEAB since 2013 has been distinguished
by his instrumental guidance through SEAB's transformative journey. Ms
Ramanathan has strengthened SEAB’s examination integrity and corporate
governance during her six-year service with her well-established experience.
Mr Chin, who was onboard the SEAB Board in 2019, leaves a legacy through
his pivotal role in facilitating the redevelopment of the SEAB Building
at 298 Jalan Bukit Ho Swee. We are deeply appreciative of their contributions
to SEAB and wish them the best in their future endeavours</p>
