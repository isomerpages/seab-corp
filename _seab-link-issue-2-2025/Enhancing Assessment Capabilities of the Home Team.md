<p>In February 2025, SEAB conducted a two-day assessment training workshop
for officers from various Home Team agencies, including the Singapore Civil
Defence Force (SCDF), Singapore Police Force (SPF), Immigration &amp; Checkpoints
Authority (ICA), Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX), and Home
Team Academy (HTA). This collaboration, part of a three-year assessment
training contract between SEAB and Home Team agencies, aims to enhance
assessment capabilities within these critical security organisations that
keep our Home safe and secure.</p>

<em>Attendees of the workshop gained insights into the history of national examinations and SEAB’s work during their tour of the Heritage Gallery.</em>
<p></p>
<p>The workshop, led by SEAB Assessment Specialists, Mdm Christine Goh and
Mr Tan Lee Sze, focused on three fundamental assessment principles and
a structured three-step assessment framework. In the course of the workshop,
Home Team officers, who serve as curriculum developers within their respective
agencies, participated actively in considering&nbsp; varied assessment
formats, including Multiple Choice Questions, Scenario-based, Source-based
questions, and Essay items that are relevant to their specific operational
contexts.</p>

<p>The programme also featured a learning journey, with visits to SEAB’s
Heritage Gallery, Digitisation Room and the Automatic Storage Retrieval
System. The enthusiasm of the participants was evident, with some officers
&nbsp;visiting the Gallery again, after the tour had concluded.</p>

<p>This collaboration &nbsp;contributed to interesting exchanges of assessment
experiences with &nbsp;the Home Team officers and also considered assessment
principles and practices beyond the education context to the dynamic and
high-stakes operational contexts of these agencies.</p>
