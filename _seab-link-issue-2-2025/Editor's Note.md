<p>Dear readers,</p>
<p>Welcome to Issue 2/2025 SEAB-link! We hope that the year has been a great
start for all of you.</p>
<p>In this issue, we bring you exciting coverage of several milestone events
that have shaped the first half of 2025. Join us as we celebrate SEAB Day
2025 "@21 Charting New Chapters", where we commemorated our coming of age
of 21 years and set our sights on new horizons for educational assessment
in Singapore.</p>
<p>Don't miss our feature on this yearâ€™s Singapore International Primary School
Examination (<em>i</em>PSLE) event, which celebrates its 20th anniversary,
highlighting two decades of global education benchmarking. This article
offers insights on how we're strengthening our international partnerships.</p>
<p>We are also pleased to share our experience in the successful conduct
of the Supplementary Admissions Exercise for International Students (S-AEIS
2025). For the first time, we made a bold move to hold the test at our
own premises for the first time for selected education levels - marking
an exciting milestone in our admissions journey! The smooth execution of
this exercise reflects our commitment to maintaining excellence in assessment
services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another notable highlight is the SEAB Assessment Symposium 2025, where
education professionals came together to explore innovative approaches
to assessment. The thoughtful feedback from participants underscores the
importance of this platform for knowledge sharing and professional development.</p>
<p>We invite you to explore these stories and more in our latest issue. Whether
you are a longtime reader or new to SEAB-link, you will find value in our
curated content that showcases SEAB's continued commitment to excellence
in educational assessment. Happy reading!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regards,
<br><em><strong>SEAB-link Editorial Team</strong></em>
