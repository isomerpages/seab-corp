<p>In his keynote address, Director of Assessment Planning and Development
Division, Mr Pek Wee Haur, emphasised that assessment is more than just
academic results – it is a powerful tool for enhancing teaching and learning
outcomes. He highlighted the importance of developing deeper understanding
in students rather than focusing solely on test preparation.</p>
<p>The symposium featured dynamic breakout sessions across different subjects
by SEAB’s assessment specialists. The session on English Language, led
by Ms Chan Sau Mei, equipped educators with strategies for vocabulary assessment
and formative assessment practices. In Science, Mr Tan Wee Siang and Ms
Sharon Tan introduced frameworks like Science Content Accuracy, Technical
Quality, Alignment, and Rationale (STAR) and Content, Complexity, Contexts,
and Response Strategy (C<sup>3</sup>R) to help teachers design quality
assessment items. Ms Karen Yap presented on Mathematics Assessment fundamentals,
introducing the 4i (4i stands for Imitate, Improve, Innovate, Invent) framework
for designing assessment items aligned to the Singapore Primary Mathematics
curriculum.</p>
