<p>This year’s celebration carried the theme “@21: Charting New Chapters,”
a tribute to SEAB’s remarkable journey and an exciting look ahead to its
future. As SEAB turns 21, it is not just about marking the passage of time
but also acknowledging the growth and transformation that has shaped SEAB
into what it is today. From our beginnings in 2004, when we were entrusted
with the task of developing and conducting national examinations in Singapore,
SEAB has evolved into a key player in the nation’s educational landscape.
The celebration was made even more special with heartfelt speeches by Chief
Executive of SEAB, Mr Yue Lip Sin, and SEAB Board Chairman, Mr Wong Siew
Hoong, who both reflected on SEAB’s journey, their appreciation to stakeholders
and staff who contributed to the various transformations and outcomes,
and shared their aspirations for its future.</p>
