<p>SEAB successfully conducted the 2025 Supplementary Admissions Exercise
for International Students (S-AEIS) and for the first time, the tests for
the Primary 2, Secondary 1 and 2 levels were conducted at SEAB’s premises
from 10 to 12 March 2025.</p>
<p>The S-AEIS, which provides international students the opportunity to join
Singapore's education system, took place from 10 to 13 March 2025. The
exercise required careful planning and coordination, particularly so as
our building is located within a residential area. Long hours were put
into the preparation works as comprehensive measures were implemented to
manage crowd flow, ensuring that the environment is conducive for the candidates’
test experience and to minimise disruption to the surrounding community.</p>
<p>Officers from SEAB’s Corporate Cluster were involved across the three
days of S-AEIS at SEAB building. Everyone worked closely to tackle any
challenges that arose, and swift decisions were made to minimise any disruptions
to the conduct of the tests.</p>
<p>All the hard work paid off as the S-AEIS was concluded successfully, with
all candidates completing their assessments. While this was no easy feat,
the successful implementation of S-AEIS 2025 demonstrates our commitment
to maintaining excellence in assessment services.</p>
<p>Pictures speak a thousand words. Let the images unfold the massive scale
of this exercise.</p>
