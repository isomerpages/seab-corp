<h4><strong>SEAB Hosts Engaging Dialogues with Educators</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>On 4 March 2025, 21 April 2025 and 24 April 2025, SEAB hosted engagement
sessions for teacher-participants from NIE’s Teacher Leaders Programme
(TLP) and Management and Leadership in Schools (MLS) Programme as well
as the Academy of Singapore Teacher’s Teacher Work Attachment Plus (TWA+).
For the TWA+, it was a collaboration between SEAB and Academy of Singapore
Teachers for the first time.</p>
<p>The sessions featured insightful presentations on "Making Assessment Relevant,
Engaging and Authentic". Following interactive Heritage Gallery tours and
breakout discussions, the educators engaged in candid yet insightful conversations
with our management panels.</p>
