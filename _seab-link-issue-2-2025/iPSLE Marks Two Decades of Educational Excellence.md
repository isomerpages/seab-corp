celebrates its 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2025, marking a significant
milestone in international education benchmarking. From humble beginnings
with just two centres and 22 students in 2005, the <em>i</em>PSLE has grown

<p><em>Representatives from 14 iPSLE centres commemorated iPSLE's 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary at the annual Business Meeting held at SEAB</em>
</p>
<p>Held annually, SEAB organised the <em>i</em>PSLE Business Meeting to &nbsp;provide
a platform for the centres and SEAB to strengthen partnership, discuss
pertinent issues, &nbsp;as well as sharing of &nbsp;best practices to ensure
the smooth and consistent conduct of the examination across all centres.
The 2025 <em>i</em>PSLE Business Meeting, held on 24 April 2025, brought
together 54 overseas delegates from 14 appointed centres in Thailand, Myanmar,
Indonesia, Maldives, Vietnam and China. The event showcased SEAB’s continued
commitment to maintaining Singapore's high educational standards internationally.</p>
<p>Recent achievements highlighted <em>&nbsp;i</em>PSLE’s success, with seven
students receiving the Singapore Ministry of Education's ASEAN scholarship
in 2024. The experience of preparing for the <em>i</em>PSLE and studying
in Singapore were shared by three of these students via a video. Besides
these seven students, 234 students received Certificates of Distinction,
Merit, Commendation, and Outstanding Subject Performance awards.</p>
<p>As part of the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebrations, participating
centres received commemorative plaques, followed by a celebratory cake-cutting
ceremony. Mr Argus Ang, CEO of The Rvi Group and Managing Director of MCTA
Group of Schools, delivered an enlightening presentation on crisis management
and business continuity measures, citing a recent example of the 7.7 magnitude
earthquake that affected their Yangon and Mandalay campuses on 28 March
2025.</p>
