<p>The GCE A-Level Project Work (PW) occupies a unique place in the curriculum,
offering group-based, interdisciplinary learning opportunities distinct
from other subjects. The transition to a Pass/Fail assessment in 2024 reflects
broader A-Level curriculum changes designed to strengthen 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies (21CC) development and cultivate genuine learning interest.
A new feature of the revised PW is the autonomy students now enjoy in selecting
projects based on their interests.&nbsp; The subject also offers problem
statements co-crafted with government agencies through the Marketplace
of Ideas (MOI), which offers another avenue for students to engage in real-world
problem-solving. Additionally, communication skills are enhanced through
the new Group Response to Questions (GRQ) segment of the Oral Presentation
(OP).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>PW serves as a platform for students to develop important 21CC, such as
critical thinking when they analyse real-world problems that Singapore
faces, and inventive thinking when they propose plausible solutions based
on their research in the Project Summary (PS). Students who have opted
to work on problem statements in the MOI are also given the opportunity
to pitch and showcase their ideas to stakeholders such as the Land Transport
Authority (LTA), the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE)
and the National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre (NVPC). PW not only
enhances students’ joy of learning but also heightens their awareness of
nationally significant issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Working in groups of four to five, the first cohort of revised PW students
in 2024 relished the freedom offered by the new open task format to explore
topics of their interest. Empowered to exercise greater agency and ownership
of their projects, students engaged more deeply with real-world issues
and problems close to their heart while developing critical and inventive
thinking. Such interest-driven efforts are evident in projects ranging
from sustainable clothing choices and cat abandonment to sleep deprivation
and financial literacy for the young. Working in groups naturally fosters
collaborative skills as students work towards a common goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The introduction of GRQ in OP further promotes collaborative learning,
critical thinking, and communication skills, better preparing students
for future academic and professional environments. Students must exercise
active listening and think on their feet to respond to questions or build
upon their teammates’ perspectives in a coherent manner. This group-based
response format has resulted in more natural and dynamic interactions that
mirror authentic social discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a world facing increasingly complex challenges, the role of the GCE
A-Level Project Work becomes ever more vital as we equip future generations
with the skills and dispositions to chart their personal journeys and contribute
to our nation’s development.</p>
