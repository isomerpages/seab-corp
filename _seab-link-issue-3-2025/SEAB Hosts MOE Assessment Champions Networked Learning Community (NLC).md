<p>Formed by the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Curriculum Policy Office (CPO),
the Assessment Champions Networked Learning Community (NLC) brings together
teachers with a common interest in assessment, either having completed
certified assessment-focused graduate programmes or through their experience.
This year, SEAB had the privilege of hosting the NLC event on 6 May 2025,
welcoming approximately 350 teachers from various Singapore schools. In
line with the vision of "Learner-centred and Balanced Assessment", the
event focused on the three key shifts of School-Based Assessment: Shifting
Assessment Mindsets, Strengthening Student Wellbeing, and Managing Teacher
Workload.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his welcome address, SEAB Chief Executive, Mr Yue Lip Sin, shared insights
on assessment approaches in education. Considering the complex world that
our children will need to navigate, he discussed research findings about
the reduced effectiveness of traditional methods such as “over-drilling”
and “template-based answers”. He encouraged educators to adopt elaboration
strategies, including reasoning and connecting information, to develop
deeper learning capabilities among students. Following that, Director of
Curriculum Policy Office and 21st Century Competencies Office, Mr Sherwin
Cheng, delivered a speech that explored the three key shifts of School-Based
Assessment and their implications for classroom assessment practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event featured breakout sessions covering topics such as data-driven
school planning, assessment culture enhancement, and Artificial Intelligence
(AI)-enabled assessment tools. These sessions facilitated meaningful discussions
on addressing schools' evolving assessment needs with teachers’ workload
in mind. Running concurrently, a marketplace segment showcased a variety
of interesting assessment practices by teachers from various primary and
secondary schools, covering assessment in the age of AI, the importance
of teacher feedback and educational technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br><em>A vibrant scene unfolded as breakout sessions buzzed with active discussions and participants explored insightful exhibits showcasing innovative practices from various institutions during the marketplace segment.</em>
</p>
<p>SEAB's Research and Development Division participated in the marketplace
segment, presenting on three Assessment for Learning tools – CATalytics,
MathsCheck<sup>Plus </sup>and Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup>. CATalytics and MathsCheck<sup>Plus </sup>employ
Adaptive Testing technology, and they have been used to support Mathematics
learning in schools. These tools assess students’ understanding of core
concepts and provide teachers with useful insights for instructional planning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attendees also had the opportunity to preview Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup>,
a new adaptive testing tool for Reading Comprehension that was launched
in July 2025. The tool provides detailed learning descriptions aligned
with local English curriculum standards. Participants expressed interest
in its potential to offer meaningful student information through an engaging
assessment experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These tools have contributed to the key shifts in School-Based Assessment
by offering personalised learning analytics, providing timely feedback
for student development, and supporting teachers with practical data insights.
Schools that are currently using these tools shared how the diagnostic
capabilities have enhanced their teaching and learning practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The collaborative spirit shown during the event reflected SEAB's commitment
to partnering with MOE and schools to enhance balanced assessment practices.
The positive response from participating schools suggests growing recognition
of how technology-enabled assessment tools can support both teaching and
learning.</p>
