<p>The SEAB Seminar represents a cornerstone event in SEAB's yearly corporate
schedule and forms an essential part of our strategic planning process.
Each June, all SEAB staff gather to receive Senior Management's sharing
on the organisation's short- and long-term priorities, the opportunities
and challenges that SEAB faces, and a dialogue for staff to discuss issues
that matter to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2025 SEAB Seminar was held on 27 June, with the theme <em>“Empower and Elevate”</em>.
“Empower” reflects our commitment to nurturing a culture where SEAB staff
grow together, gain confidence, and find purpose and joy in their work.
“Elevate” represents our collective ambition to scale the next S-curve,
advancing the frontiers of educational assessment. This year’s programme
blended learning journeys, expert insights, practical skills, and meaningful
conversations — equipping staff with the knowledge, tools, and cultural
momentum to turn vision into action.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Learning Journeys</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In the days leading up to the Seminar, staff took part in learning journeys
to three different organisations, offering fresh perspectives on innovation,
transformation, and people-centric growth.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GovTech</strong>  <em>(25 June)</em> – SEAB staff learned about GovTech’s
strategic transition towards <em>Digital Government Blueprint (DGB) 2.0</em> and
Digital Excellence &amp; Products Division (DXD)’s objectives to produce
user-centric digital solutions for Ministry of Education (MOE). The visit
concluded with a tour to the Smart City Technology Division, with stations
that feature practical applications of emerging technologies developed
at GovTech.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)</strong>  <em>(27 June)</em> –
At the Singapore City Gallery in the URA Centre, SEAB staff explored interactive
exhibits on Singapore’s urban transformation, from land optimisation strategies
to heritage conservation. The large-scale island model and immersive displays
gave participants a deeper appreciation of the challenges and innovations
in sustainable urban development.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Port of Singapore Authority (PSA)</strong>  <em>(27 June)</em> –
SEAB staff discovered PSA’s transformation journey and how it leverages
technology to remain at the forefront of the maritime industry. Hands-on
simulation activities at PSA University were a highlight, alongside insights
into PSA’s people-centric approach and commitment to employee upskilling.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Across all three venues, participants valued the opportunity to see how
different organisations <em>empower</em> their people and <em>elevate</em> their
capabilities through innovation. Special thanks go to our hosts for their
warm hospitality and for curating such rich and engaging experiences.</p>

<h4><strong>Keynote Sharing by GovTech: AI in the Future of Assessment</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The afternoon seminar opened with Mr John Soh, Lead Data Scientist, DXD,
and Ms Irene Lam, Deputy Director, DXD, from GovTech, who spoke on <em>“Rethinking Exams: How Artificial Intelligence Can Shape the Future of Assessment.” </em>They
outlined the latest AI trends and demonstrated tools such as Authoring
Co-pilot, which reduces human effort in the initial authoring of questions,
and iMAT (Instant Message Analyzer Tool), which identifies inquiry patterns
and generates actionable insights. By reducing repetitive workload, these
innovations empower assessment officers to focus on higher-value work that
demands human judgment and expertise. The session concluded with a forward-looking
prose on how AI could elevate assessment practices and enable SEAB to stay
ahead in a rapidly evolving assessment landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h4><strong>Hands-on AI Sessions by Research and Development Division</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The spirit of “Empower and Elevate” continued with two concurrent hands-on
sessions by colleagues from the Research and Development Division (RDD),
giving staff the opportunity to experience practical AI applications.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“No Typing Required” </strong>introduced voice commands and screen
captures as alternative ways to interact with AI tools. Participants learned
how to draft emails, generate content, and solve problems without touching
a keyboard, empowering them to work more intuitively and efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“Transforming Work through AI Applications”</strong> showcased
how AI chatbots, ChatGPT, Pair Chat, and Visual Basic for Applications
(VBA) automation can simplify administrative tasks and provide instant,
accurate information to staff and stakeholders. By making automation accessible
to all, the session elevated the possibilities for improving workflow and
responsiveness, regardless of technical background.&nbsp;</p>
</li>

<h4><strong>Culture Traits Engagement</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Following the AI sessions, the HR Department led an engagement exercise
on SEAB’s evolving culture traits. HR recapped SEAB’s Vision, Mission,
Values, and strategic thrusts, and shared findings from earlier 2025 survey
and leadership retreats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two key insights emerged: SEAB’s values are timeless and remain our guiding
pillars, but our culture traits must adapt to the way we work today and
in the future. SEAB staff identified the traits they believed would empower
individuals and teams to work more effectively and elevate SEAB’s ability
to scale the next S-curve. The inputs were then consolidated for management’s
decision of the refreshed cultural traits.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<h4><strong>Reflection and Dialogue with Senior Management</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In the final segment, SEAB staff reflected on the day’s insights and posed
questions for senior management. The questions — spanning Career Growth
&amp; Development, People &amp; Leadership, Processes &amp; Workflow, Resourcing
&amp; Tools, and Workplace Environment &amp; Well-being — reflected the
collective desire to elevate the organisation’s impact and shape a workplace
that cares for its people. The key questions were addressed by senior management
which reinforced a shared commitment to listening, learning, and adapting
together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Seminar concluded with group photos, marking the end of a purposeful
afternoon. The conversations, skills, and ideas shared at the 2025 SEAB
Seminar were not meant to stay in the room — they are a call to action.
As we move forward under the theme “Empower and Elevate”, SEAB staff are
encouraged to apply new tools, embody our evolving culture traits, and
work together to advance SEAB’s mission with confidence and ambition.&nbsp;</p>
