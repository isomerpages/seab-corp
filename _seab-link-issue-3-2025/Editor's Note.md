<p>Dear Readers,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the September 2025 edition of SEAB-link! This issue features
14 articles highlighting key developments and initiatives that are shaping
Singapore's assessment landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Advancing Assessment for Learning&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were delighted to host the MOE Assessment Champions Networked Learning
Community meeting in May, welcoming 350 teachers to explore learner-centred
assessment practices. Participants had the opportunity to experience our
adaptive testing tools – CATalytics, MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup>, and the
newly launched Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup> – which were designed to support
personalised learning in schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was followed by our first in-person Assessment for Learning sharing
session in July 2025, where 300 school leaders from 96 primary schools
discovered practical applications of these tools and shared valuable insights
with their peers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Expanding e-Examinations</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2025 marked another milestone for e-Examinations as H2 China Studies subjects
became the first Humanities subjects to implement hybrid e-written examinations
at A-Level. This development reflects our ongoing commitment to modernising
assessment while maintaining high standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing Access Arrangements</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following successful pilot studies, buzzer devices are now available as
standard tools for national examinations. These helpful attention-support
devices can now be used without special applications, making implementation
simpler for schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Making a Difference</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond our work in assessment, this issue also showcases how SEAB staff
are contributing to the community through their volunteer efforts at Willing
Hearts, demonstrating our commitment to social responsibility and helping
the less fortunate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>More to Discover</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These featured stories represent just five of the 14 articles in this
issue. We encourage you to explore the remaining pieces, which offer additional
insights into our ongoing contributions to elevate assessment and positive
impact for our education community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy reading about these developments in these stories as
we continue our shared mission of excellence in assessment.&nbsp;</p>
