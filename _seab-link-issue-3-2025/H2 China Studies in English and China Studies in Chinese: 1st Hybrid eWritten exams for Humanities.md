<p>2025 marks another milestone for our e-Examinations journey, as Hybrid
e-Written examinations are first introduced for Humanities Subjects at
GCE A-Level. For both A-Level China Studies in English (CSE) and China
Studies in Chinese (CSC), candidates will receive physical question papers
and submit their responses digitally through SEAB's e-Examination system
using the Digital Answer Booklet (DAB).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In preparation for the 2025 GCE A-Level e-Written Examinations, practice
sessions were conducted in April this year. These practice sessions were
designed to familiarise candidates with their respective examination formats
before the year-end examinations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shift to electronic examinations for CSE and CSC is driven by three
key factors: First, candidates are already well-prepared through their
regular use of the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) and Personal
Learning Devices (PLDs) introduced in 2021. Second, computer-based writing
offers valuable editing capabilities that help candidates better plan,
organise, and refine their essays for improved clarity and coherence. Finally,
this transition helps prepare candidates for the digital nature of the
modern workplace, preparing our students for the world of work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CSE e-written examination practice sessions were successfully conducted
with 137 candidates from Anglo-Chinese Junior College, Jurong Pioneer Junior
College, Victoria Junior College, and Yishun Innova Junior College. The
sessions demonstrated a seamless login process and straightforward access
to the DAB. Students responded positively to the hybrid format, particularly
appreciating the use of physical question papers for answer planning and
annotation while typing their responses digitally. Features of the DAB
that were especially well-received by candidates were the timer and editing
tools. Candidates also found value in the review and bookmark functions,
which enabled them to easily track and return to partially completed or
questions not attempted, so that they could return to them easily. Majority
of the students liked the experience of taking the computer-based exam
and prefer it to paper-based exams.</p>

<p>A total of 164 candidates from Dunman High School, Eunoia Junior College,
Hwa Chong Institution, and River Valley High School participated in the
CSC e-written examination practice sessions.&nbsp; Most candidates expressed
comfort with typing in Chinese Language and preferred taking the examination
on a computer rather than writing on paper. They appreciated the ease of
editing and organising their responses in the DAB.</p>

<p>The practice sessions for both China Studies in English and China Studies
in Chinese proved highly successful, with candidates demonstrating confidence
and competence in navigating their respective examination formats. Students'
positive experience and readiness to handle the hybrid e-Exam format bode
well for the upcoming examinations in November. Moreover, the smooth implementation
and favourable reception of these practice sessions serve as an encouraging
precedent for the future rollout of e-Written examinations across other
GCE A-Level subjects in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>
