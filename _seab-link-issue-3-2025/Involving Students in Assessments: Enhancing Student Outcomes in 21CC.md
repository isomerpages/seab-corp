<p>2025 saw SEAB launch a new series of workshops titled <em>Involving Students in Assessment: Enhancing student outcomes in </em>21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies (<em>21CC)</em>. This series drew strong participation from
Key Personnel and School Leaders across primary schools, secondary schools
and junior colleges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The series guides Singapore educators in examining student agency and
its vital role in developing 21CC.&nbsp; equipping them with practical
assessment strategies. Participants learn to integrate agency within the
Learning-Assessment Cycle, design assessments that promote student ownership,
and align planning with teaching practices. Through reflection, educators
develop approaches to empower students in their learning journey.&nbsp;</p>
