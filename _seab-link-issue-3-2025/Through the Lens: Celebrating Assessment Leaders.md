<p><em>This article was written from the perspective of SEAB's staff member, Zuhairee Ramlan, Assistant Manager (Digital Media). He is the official photographer for the event.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a photographer covering key events in SEAB, I had the privilege of
capturing a significant milestone in Singapore's educational landscape.
Through my lens, I witnessed not just a graduation ceremony but observed
how teachers approach assessment in education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 4 June 2025, 35 educators celebrated a milestone in assessment leadership
at the <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/training-and-consultancy/seab-in-house-workshops/" class="Hyperlink SCXW225069267 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Certificate in Examination and Assessment in Education (CEA in Edn)</u></a> graduation
ceremony.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>These teachers were not just graduating from the programme—they were set
to champion assessment practices in Singapore's classrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through my lens, I captured Ms Lee Chun Hua's confident stance as she
delivered her valedictorian address. The Marsiling Primary School educator
emphasised the importance of strengthening validity and reliability through
students' responses to feedback.&nbsp;</p>

<br><em>Right: CEA graduates listening attentively to Ms Lee Chun Hua’s speech.</em>
<p></p>
<p>As she spoke, I observed her fellow graduates nodding in recognition as
she outlined her evidence-based practices:<br>
<br>1. Systematic collection of student responses<br>
<br>2. Analysis of feedback effectiveness&nbsp;<br>
<br>3. Continuous refinement of assessment methods&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her journey revealed two fundamental truths about educational assessment:
First, what we measure shapes what we achieve. Second, how we respond to
that measurement determines our growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The culmination of her message was both simple and profound: "Use assessment
as a compass, not an anchor." This was not just a metaphor—it was a framework
for action. The metaphor resonated deeply with everyone present, as reflected
in the thoughtful expressions I captured in that moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each graduate then went on to receive their certificate to celebrate their
successful completion of the programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The atmosphere shifted from ceremonial to engagement as Senior Assessment
Specialist (Sciences), Mr Tan Lee Sze, demonstrated SEAB's e-Examination
systems through a technical showcase. His presentation revealed a fascinating
fact how SEAB has thoughtfully implemented e-Examinations: Innovation does
not happen in leaps. It happens in iterations. Each feature of the electronic
assessment system represented countless hours of refinement, and rigorous
testing, to enhance the examination experience for the candidates.</p>

<p>The final segment of the programme brought together Chief Executive, Mr
Yue Lip Sin and Directors of Assessment Planning and Development Division,
Mr Tan Kuo Cheang and Mr Pek Wee Haur, in an engaging dialogue session.
The discussion highlighted the importance of SEAB and teachers working
together to navigate today’s volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous
(VUCA) world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>As the event came to an end, one thing was clear: This was more than just
a graduation ceremony. My photographs had captured something more significant:
a community of educators ready to enhance assessment practices in Singapore's
schools, one thoughtful step at a time.</p>
