<p>Continuing SEAB's commitment to corporate social responsibility, we engaged
with Willing Hearts, Singapore’s largest soup kitchen. Willing Hearts prepares
and distributes nearly 9,000 meals daily across 70 locations island-wide,
serving beneficiaries such as the elderly, persons with disabilities, low-income
families, and migrant workers. Through their meal provision service, they
strive to improve lives with dignity and care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mark SG60, our goal was to have 60 SEAB staff join the event—but we
were delighted when even more signed up, achieving 65 volunteers. Over
six sessions, held between 24 June and 4 August 2025, SEAB staff rolled
up their sleeves and contributed to a variety of tasks, including food
preparation, washing utensils, meal packing, and food delivery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team immediately demonstrated great teamwork and enthusiasm as they
chopped, portioned, packed, and cleaned alongside the kitchen’s regular
crew. While the tasks were physically demanding, the shared laughter, camaraderie,
and the knowledge that every effort contributed to someone’s next meal
made the experience deeply rewarding. For many, it was also a humbling
reminder of the importance of compassion and community service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A big thank you goes out to all SEAB staff who took time out of their
busy schedules to give back. Not only did we achieve our target,
but more importantly, we came together to nurture a kinder, more compassionate,
and more “we-first” society—embodying the SG spirit of unity and service
that continues to bind us together.</p>
