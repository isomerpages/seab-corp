<p>The annual Singapore-Cambridge Consultative Committee Meeting (CCM) brings
together key educational partners: the Ministry of Education, Singapore
Examinations and Assessment Board, and Cambridge University Press and Assessment.
This strategic platform enables these institutions to exchange valuable
insights on assessment developments, share research findings, and discuss
emerging trends in educational practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, Cambridge hosted the annual CCM in July 2025 at its premises
in the United Kingdom. At the meeting, the forthcoming Singapore-Cambridge
Secondary Education Certificate, set to launch in 2027, was presented,
with both parties expressing confidence in the transition plans. Updates
on e-Examinations were also provided, including presentations of items
from GCE N(T)-Level Science and Computing, as well as O-Level Exercise
and Sports Science. The implementation of e-Examinations has yielded positive
outcomes for both test developers and test-takers. By harnessing technology's
affordances, we can now assess constructs not possible in paper-based examinations.
Students have also provided encouraging feedback about their e-Examination
experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Singapore delegation also delivered presentations on key educational
initiatives that included the use of Educational Technology and AI in teaching,
learning and assessment, and educational reforms in both countries. The
meeting also discussed efforts by education systems on both sides to improve
student health and wellbeing as well as addressed curriculum and assessment
approaches for climate change and sustainability education.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of the CCM to showcase the local education and educational initiatives,
Cambridge arranged visits to a school and research institute. The Singapore
delegation visited Long Road Sixth Form College on the first day of its
Open House, where the college was expecting about 9,000 parents and their
children. It is an institution with a 50-year heritage that serves about
2,500 students aged 16 to 19 from diverse educational backgrounds. True
to its mission of student empowerment, the college offers a broad curriculum,
equipping its students with relevant skills for their future careers. Through
its VESPA programme, focusing on Vision, Effort, Systems, Practice and
Attitude, the college has fostered resilience and confidence in students.
Under effective leadership, the college has seen improvements in qualification
achievement rates. The college was rated by the UK’s Ofsted as ‘Good’ in
its overall effectiveness in teaching, learning and assessment. Notably,
it has been successful in supporting high-needs students, who make good
progress and outperform their peers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another visit was made to the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI), established
in 1920 as part of the University of Cambridge. Dr David Waterhouse, the
curator of SPRI, hosted the Singapore delegation. As he guided the delegates
through the museum, he regaled the group with interesting facts about the
Arctic and Antarctic regions and the exciting work carried out by researchers
in their quest to better understand the polar regions. With his good-natured
humour, he clarified the common misconception that polar bears and penguins
live together. In fact, they never naturally encounter each other, as polar
bears are found in the Arctic while penguins live in the Antarctic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2025 CCM concluded with a successful and enjoyable meeting of educational
partners who engaged in in-depth discussions and exchanged ideas about
current and future developments in education and assessments. This platform
has cemented and will continue to strengthen the professional working relationships
and friendships that the educational partners have established.&nbsp;</p>
