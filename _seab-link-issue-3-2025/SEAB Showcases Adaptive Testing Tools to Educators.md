<p>Conducted in-person for the first time, an Assessment for Learning (AfL)
sharing session was organised by the Research and Development Division
for about 300 school leaders and educators from 96 primary schools on 11
July 2025. The event showcased three <a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/assessment-for-learning-afl-tools/" class="Hyperlink SCXW243427806 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>adaptive testing tools</u></a> –
MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup>, CATalytics, and Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup>.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>Mr Kelvin Lim, Director of Research and Development Division, opened the
event by highlighting the importance of collaborative innovation in education
and announced the launch of the new English Language adaptive testing tool
developed by SEAB - Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup>. Plans are underway to integrate
these Assessment for Learning (AfL) tools into the Student Learning Space
(SLS), which provide teachers with a unified platform for all their assessment
needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Koh Poh Wee, Research Specialist and the event’s keynote speaker, demonstrated
how adaptive testing serves as a crucial bridge connecting three educational
pillars: learning science, assessment, and instruction. Her presentation
revealed how adaptive testing dynamically adjusts to each student's level,
creating productive challenges while providing immediate feedback, which
helps teachers make data-driven decisions to support student learning effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants then attended two parallel breakout sessions focusing on
adaptive testing tools for Mathematics and English Language. The Mathematics
breakout session opened with SEAB’s Lead Research Specialist, Ms Esther
Yee's comprehensive overview of MathsCheck<sup>Plus </sup>and CATalytics,
demonstrating how these digital assessment tools work complementarily.&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>Dr Chang Suo Hui from Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) then delved
into the critical area of word problems, presenting a three-pronged approach
to problem-solving.&nbsp; She explored the concept of “Understanding the
Problem” from three perspectives – reading and recognition, comprehension
and transformation, offering educators practical strategies to guide students
through mathematical challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Townsville Primary School's journey with MathsCheck<sup>Plus </sup>and
CATalytics, as shared by Ms Pearl Chua, demonstrated the transformative
power of data-driven decision-making in education. Through strategic use
of the reports, their teachers shifted their instructional mindsets and
learnt to make meaningful use of data. Their participation in the P2 MathsCheck
Champion Support Group has further catalysed teacher growth, fostering
both pedagogical excellence and professional development.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Active participation from educators during the Mathematics breakout session's Q&amp;A.</em>
</p>
<p>The English breakout session began with Dr Elizabeth Pang from the Ministry
of Education’s Curriculum Planning and Development Division giving an overview
of the development of Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup>, an adaptive tool that measures
students' individual reading capabilities and provides detailed performance
data for teachers along with teaching suggestions that integrate with STELLAR
materials to support targeted instruction. Dr Tay May Yin from English
Language Institute of Singapore (ELIS) introduced the Read2Learn Networked
Learning Community (NLC), highlighting its key objectives: supporting teachers
through cross-school collaboration, deepening professional knowledge, and
fostering teacher leadership. The NLC serves as a platform to build collective
expertise while encouraging continuous professional learning among educators.</p>

</p>
<p>Their presentations were followed by sharing from two primary schools.
Mdm Annisa from Tanjong Katong Primary School explained their adoption
of Read2Learn for its alignment with their assessment principles, citing
its adaptive testing features, English Language Syllabus alignment, and
comprehensive support system from master teachers through the NLC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mdm Chin Sau Lai and Mdm Malar from Princess Elizabeth Primary School
further highlighted how Read2Learn’s NLC enhanced their teaching effectiveness
through data-driven practices, peer learning, and improved instructional
coaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>Following the presentations, participants explored an interactive exhibition
featuring Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup>. The hands-on showcase provided a unique
opportunity for educators to experience the platform's features firsthand
and engage in meaningful discussions with SEAB researchers who spearheaded
its development.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Participants eagerly seek clarifications from the Read2Learn team members as they explore some of the exhibits on showcase.</em>
</p>
<p>The 2025 Assessment for Learning Sharing Session concluded on a high note
with enthusiastic participation during the Q&amp;A session, demonstrating
educators' deep commitment to assessment innovation. In essence, this milestone
event marks another step forward in strengthening the partnership between
schools and SEAB towards providing excellence in educational assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>MOE schools can register their students for free access to these diagnostic
assessments, which are scheduled at specific times throughout the academic
year:&nbsp; MathsCheck<sup>Plus</sup> takes place in October/November, while
CATalytics and Read2Learn<sup>EL</sup> assessments are conducted between
January to March.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
