<p>At the 26th Academic Forum on English Language Testing in Asia (AFELTA),
researchers and practitioners from various examination and assessment organisations
in Asia discussed the affordances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in large-scale
language testing, as well as the responsible and sustainable use of AI
in diverse educational and policy contexts. The forum, hosted by Shanghai
International Studies University (SISU), was held from 21 to 22 August
2025 in Shanghai.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Xun Yan, Professor of Linguistics, Second Language Acquisition and
Teacher Education, and Educational Psychology at University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign delivered the keynote speech on recent developments
in AI-empowered language testing and assessment across four key domains:
automated item generation and delivery, automated scoring, test security,
and adaptive testing.</p>
<p>SEAB was represented by Senior Assessment Specialist Mr Andrew Leo and
Assessment Officer Ms Serene Tan, both from the Assessment Planning and
Development Division. The team shared the following: (1) how technology
is leveraged to enhance teaching, learning and assessment in Singapore,
(2) SEAB’s e-Examination journey, and (3) the implementation of GCE N(T)-level
English Language Paper 1 e-Examination in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delegates interested in e-Examination implementation found the segment
on SEAB’s e-Examination journey and application of technological affordances
to augment authenticity and interactivity within an English national assessment
especially valuable. They also appreciated the sharing on how AI-enabled
tools in the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) facilitate the provision
of immediate and customised feedback to students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEAB team also gleaned valuable insights into ongoing research and
studies pertaining to English Language testing in other countries.</p>
<p>For example, Shanghai International Studies University (SISU), having
explored the integration of Artificial Intelligence into the development
and validation of its Test for English Majors (TEM), shared the potential
and limitations of this approach.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA) shared its
exploration of transitioning the delivery mode of its speaking paper from
face-to-face to an Internet-Delivered Speaking Test using a video conferencing
platform.</p>
<p>The Korea English Language Testing Association (KELTA) shared its findings
on the potential of AI and immersive environments in enhancing descriptive
assessment practices in primary English.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second day of the conference featured a round-table discussion titled <em>Applying AI in Language Testing and Assessment: Challenges and Ethical Considerations</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
the dialogue, each organisation was invited to share current practices
and approaches on the application of AI in language testing and assessment.
SEAB further shared about AI-enabled tools for more learner-centred assessments
as well as the AI in Education Ethics Framework developed by the Ministry
of Education, Singapore. The latter was of particular interest to the other
delegates, who share similar concerns regarding the responsible and sustainable
use of AI in language testing and assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the dialogue, researchers and practitioners discussed various aspects
such as the expertise required for AI integration and core local assessment
problems that AI can address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the conference was an enriching and enjoyable one as it offered
much insight into English Language testing in Asia – in particular, the
fundamental issues and ethical considerations in leveraging AI in language
testing assessment as well as opportunities to network with researchers
and practitioners across Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Visit to the Shanghai Municipal Educational Examinations Authority</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 20 August, Mr Andrew Leo and Ms Serene Tan, also paid a special visit
to the Shanghai Municipal Educational Examinations Authority<strong> </strong>(SMEEA)
to congratulate them on their 30th Anniversary this year. On behalf of
SEAB, they presented SMEEA with a lacquerware plaque and a congratulatory
letter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Established in June 1995, the SMEEA oversees various entrance examinations
in Shanghai, including the National College Entrance Examination or Gao
Kao (高 考). The visit on this commemorative occasion reinforces the longstanding
relationship and professional ties between SEAB and SMEEA forged over the
years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SMEEA had visited SEAB in 2019 and 2024. The Centre Director of SMEEA,
Ms Zhang Bo【章波院长】, was very appreciative of SEAB’s visit to congratulate
them on their 30th Anniversary. She extended her sincere gratitude to our
Chief Executive, Mr Yue Lip Sin and staff of SEAB. We hope to continue
to strengthen the bonds and close network that we have established in the
coming years.&nbsp;</p>
