<h4><strong>Fostering International Partnerships in Educational Assessment</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>SEAB welcomed two international delegations in August 2025, one from Thailand's
National Institute of Educational Testing Service (NIETS) and another from
the Brazilian Congressional Education Caucus (Frente Parlamentar Mista
da Educação, FPME). Both visits underscored SEAB's esteemed role in the
assessment community at the international front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 11 August 2025, in a meaningful reunion marking 10 years since their
last visit to SEAB in 2015, a 17-member delegation from NIETS, led by its
Director, Assistant Professor Sirida Burachat, returned for another exchange.
This visit was also particularly significant as it coincided with NIETS'
20th anniversary. NIETS is responsible for overseeing and conducting educational
assessments in Thailand. This includes administering standardised high-stake
and mandatory examinations, such as the Ordinary National Educational Test
(O-NET) and other tests for different school levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 18 August 2025, in a pioneering engagement with Brazil, SEAB hosted
a big delegation from the Brazilian Congressional Education Caucus (Frente
Parlamentar Mista da Educação, FPME). Led by Mr Rafael de Goes Brito, Leader
of the National Education Plan and Federal Representative, the delegation
comprised 24 parliamentarians who champion quality public education in
Brazil, with key priorities including universal access to education, early
childhood development, and the expansion of technical and vocational training.
The delegation's visit to SEAB was part of their broader study trip to
Singapore's educational institutions, including Ministry of Education (MOE),
Institute of Technical Education (ITE), National Institute of Education
(NIE), and the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST). This comprehensive
tour reflects their commitment to understanding Singapore's education achievements
and gathering insights to inform Brazil's educational changes while fostering
bilateral collaboration between both countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The visits for both organisations began with a tour of SEAB's exam operations
facility, where the delegation gained firsthand insights into our secure
facilities and digital infrastructure. The delegates showed keen interest
in SEAB's digital transformation journey, particularly our e-Examinations
platform and suite of adaptive testing tools - innovations that align closely
with their own strategic direction towards digital assessment. The visit
was marked by candid exchanges between SEAB and both organisations about
practical challenges and experiences in educational assessment, fostering
an environment of mutual learning and trust.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The open dialogue with NIETS allowed for rich discussions about assessment innovations and challenges.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>These visits from international delegations reflect SEAB's growing role
in international educational assessment discourse. Through such exchanges,
we not only share Singapore's assessment expertise but also gain valuable
insights into global educational developments and challenges. These visits
strengthen our international partnerships and contribute to the continuous
improvement of assessment practices worldwide. As we continue to host delegations
from various countries, SEAB remains committed to fostering meaningful
collaborations that advance educational assessment both locally and globally.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>SEAB wraps up 2025 Conversations sessions with teacher participants&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>SEAB recently welcomed teacher participants from NIE's Management and
Leadership in Schools (MLS) Programme and Teacher Leaders Programme (TLP)
for specially curated engagement sessions on 12 August and 25 August 2025
respectively. Building on the success of previous Conversations with SEAB
sessions throughout the years, this final run of 2025 was equally fruitful
in fostering meaningful connections with the education community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Representatives from the Assessment Planning and Development Division
(APDD) delivered insightful presentations on making assessments engaging,
relevant and authentic. The sessions resonated strongly with participants,
who appreciated the comprehensive and thought-provoking content shared.
The programme also included a guided tour of SEAB's Heritage Gallery where
participants learned about the history of national examinations and SEAB’s
work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dialogue sessions with SEAB management, which serve as the cornerstone
of every Conversations with SEAB session, provided a conducive environment
for teachers to raise questions about national examinations. These interactive
exchanges also enabled participants to offer valuable feedback, helping
SEAB continuously improve and refine our assessment processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These engagement initiatives reflect SEAB's ongoing commitment to fostering
meaningful partnerships with the education community and sharing our recent
developments and initiatives on assessment. As a thoughtful gesture to
commemorate Teachers' Day in advance, each participant was presented with
a cupcake, acknowledging their dedication to the teaching profession and
SEAB's appreciation for educators as key stakeholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Feedback from the coordinator, on behalf of MLS participants</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The visit to SEAB offered a comprehensive view of how SEAB continues to
evolve national examinations to be more relevant, engaging, and authentic,
with a strong emphasis on higher-order thinking, real-world application,
and e21CC.</p>
<p>It was inspiring to learn how SEAB harnesses technology to enhance the
efficiency and authenticity of national examinations, from the use of rich
media in e-Exams to innovative assessment modes that better reflect real-life
contexts. The sharing on Assessment for Learning (AfL) tools currently
in development also highlighted SEAB’s forward-thinking approach to supporting
teaching and learning, and do not just focus on examinations.</p>
<p>I particularly enjoyed the tour of the SEAB Heritage Gallery, as it provided
an insightful journey into the organisation’s history and its pivotal role
in shaping Singapore’s education landscape. We also had the privilege to
engage in a candid dialogue with SEAB’s senior management — Mr Yue Lip
Sin (Chief Executive), Mr Tan Kuo Cheang (Director, Assessment Planning
and Development), and Mr Pang Chong Han (Director, Exam Operations). Their
sharing gave us a deeper understanding of the rationale and considerations
behind key decisions, reinforcing the alignment between policy intent,
assessment design, and educational outcomes.</p>
<p>This visit has enriched my perspective on assessment as a powerful driver
of learning, and deepened my appreciation for SEAB’s commitment to upholding
the integrity, fairness, and relevance of our national examinations. I
am grateful for the warm hospitality and the opportunity to engage meaningfully
with the team behind this important national mission. The MLS participants
were also particularly grateful to receive an early Teachers' Day gift
from the thoughtful SEAB team. Thank you!</p>

<p><strong><em>Feedback from the coordinator, on behalf of TLP participants</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Dear SEAB,</p>
<p>On behalf of our teacher participants, we would like to express our heartfelt
appreciation to SEAB for the warm welcome and the valuable insights shared
during our visit.</p>
<p>The tour of SEAB’s Heritage Gallery was a highlight, offering us a fascinating
glimpse into the history of national examinations and SEAB’s important
role over the years. We were surprised to learn that the PSLE started as
far back as 1960, a reminder of how far the assessment landscape has come.
Learning about the future direction of e-Examinations also gave us a sense
of how assessment is evolving to stay relevant.</p>
<p>The discussion on ‘Making Assessment Relevant, Progressive and Authentic’
was enriching, as it clarified common myths and highlighted how assessments
are made authentic through real-world problem contexts. The sharing of
Coursework, including the Design Project (Design and Technology) and Authentic
Studio Practice (Art), along with the videos of students’ submissions,
left teachers inspired and awed by their passion and creativity.</p>
<p>We really appreciated the dialogue with SEAB’s senior management. It was
indeed a rare and valuable opportunity. The question-and-answer session
allowed teacher participants to voice our thoughts and concerns openly,
and we felt assured knowing that our perspectives were heard and respected.
Thank you once again for the generous sharing, the thoughtful engagement,
and for opening up this meaningful space for dialogue and learning.</p>
<p>Lastly, our TLP team believes that visiting the SEAB Heritage Gallery
should be a rite of passage for every teacher, a chance to walk through
the rich history and inspiring journey of examinations in Singapore, and
to carry forward a deeper appreciation of the legacy we are part of.</p>
<p>Thank you, SEAB.</p>
<p></p>

<h4><strong>SEAB Explores Electronic Examination Best Practices with New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA)</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>On 20 May 2025, SEAB engaged in a productive virtual conference with the
New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) to exchange insights on electronic
examination implementation. NZQA is the New Zealand government agency tasked
with administering educational assessment and qualifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both organisations have been working towards enabling electronic examinations,
with NZQA showing positive results in adoption rate of e-Examinations by
schools. The session brought together senior leadership from both organisations,
including NZQA's Chief Executive, Mr Grant Klinkum, Deputy Chief Executive,
Ms Jann Marshall, and Chief Examinations Operating Officer, Ms Sheryl Ching.&nbsp;
SEAB was represented by Chief Executive, Mr Yue Lip Sin, along with Directors
of Assessment Planning and Development Division, Mr Tan Kuo Cheang and
Mr Pek Wee Haur, Director of Exam Operations Division, Mr Pang Chong Han,
Director of Research and Development Division, Mr Kelvin Lim, and other
staff members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the discussion, SEAB shared about electronic examinations (e-Examinations),
highlighting our change management strategies for e-Examinations transition,
development of accessible and inclusive e-Examinations, and operational
transformation initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both organisations shared their experiences and strategies in maintaining
examination standards while leveraging technology to enhance efficiency.
The conversation also covered emerging trends and possibilities in educational
assessment including automated marking systems. Both organisations also
shared their respective approaches to modernising examination systems while
ensuring quality and integrity.&nbsp;</p>
