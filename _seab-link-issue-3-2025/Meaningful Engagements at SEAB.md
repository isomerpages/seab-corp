<h4><strong>Fostering International Partnerships in Educational Assessment</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>SEAB welcomed two international delegations in August 2025, one from Thailand's
National Institute of Educational Testing Service (NIETS) and another from
the Brazilian Congressional Education Caucus (Frente Parlamentar Mista
da Educação, FPME). Both visits underscored SEAB's esteemed role in the
assessment community at the international front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 11 August 2025, in a meaningful reunion marking 10 years since their
last visit to SEAB in 2015, a 17-member delegation from NIETS, led by its
Director, Assistant Professor Sirida Burachat, returned for another exchange.
This visit was also particularly significant as it coincided with NIETS'
20th anniversary. NIETS is responsible for overseeing and conducting educational
assessments in Thailand. This includes administering standardised high-stake
and mandatory examinations, such as the Ordinary National Educational Test
(O-NET) and other tests for different school levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 18 August 2025, in a pioneering engagement with Brazil, SEAB hosted
a big delegation from the Brazilian Congressional Education Caucus (Frente
Parlamentar Mista da Educação, FPME). Led by Mr Rafael de Goes Brito, Leader
of the National Education Plan and Federal Representative, the delegation
comprised 24 parliamentarians who champion quality public education in
Brazil, with key priorities including universal access to education, early
childhood development, and the expansion of technical and vocational training.
The delegation's visit to SEAB was part of their broader study trip to
Singapore's educational institutions, including Ministry of Education (MOE),
Institute of Technical Education (ITE), National Institute of Education
(NIE), and the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST). This comprehensive
tour reflects their commitment to understanding Singapore's education achievements
and gathering insights to inform Brazil's educational changes while fostering
bilateral collaboration between both countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The visits for both organisations began with a tour of SEAB's exam operations
facility, where the delegation gained firsthand insights into our secure
facilities and digital infrastructure. The delegates showed keen interest
in SEAB's digital transformation journey, particularly our e-Examinations
platform and suite of adaptive testing tools - innovations that align closely
with their own strategic direction towards digital assessment. The visit
was marked by candid exchanges between SEAB and both organisations about
practical challenges and experiences in educational assessment, fostering
an environment of mutual learning and trust.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The open dialogue with NIETS allowed for rich discussions about assessment innovations and challenges.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>NIETS' visit was particularly memorable with an exchange of commemorative gifts marking their 20th anniversary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>

</p>
<p>These visits from international delegations reflect SEAB's growing role
in international educational assessment discourse. Through such exchanges,
we not only share Singapore's assessment expertise but also gain valuable
insights into global educational developments and challenges. These visits
strengthen our international partnerships and contribute to the continuous
improvement of assessment practices worldwide. As we continue to host delegations
from various countries, SEAB remains committed to fostering meaningful
collaborations that advance educational assessment both locally and globally.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>SEAB wraps up 2025 Conversations sessions with teacher participants&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>SEAB recently welcomed teacher participants from NIE's Management and
Leadership in Schools (MLS) Programme and Teacher Leaders Programme (TLP)
for specially curated engagement sessions on 12 August and 25 August 2025
respectively. Building on the success of previous Conversations with SEAB
sessions throughout the years, this final run of 2025 was equally fruitful
in fostering meaningful connections with the education community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Representatives from the Assessment Planning and Development Division
(APDD) delivered insightful presentations on making assessments engaging,
relevant and authentic. The sessions resonated strongly with participants,
who appreciated the comprehensive and thought-provoking content shared.
The programme also included a guided tour of SEAB's Heritage Gallery where
participants learned about the history of national examinations and SEAB’s
work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dialogue sessions with SEAB management, which serve as the cornerstone
of every Conversations with SEAB session, provided a conducive environment
for teachers to raise questions about national examinations. These interactive
exchanges also enabled participants to offer valuable feedback, helping
SEAB continuously improve and refine our assessment processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These engagement initiatives reflect SEAB's ongoing commitment to fostering
meaningful partnerships with the education community and sharing our recent
developments and initiatives on assessment. As a thoughtful gesture to
commemorate Teachers' Day in advance, each participant was presented with
a cupcake, acknowledging their dedication to the teaching profession and
SEAB's appreciation for educators as key stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>SEAB Explores Electronic Examination Best Practices with New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA)</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>On 20 May 2025, SEAB engaged in a productive virtual conference with the
New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) to exchange insights on electronic
examination implementation. NZQA is the New Zealand government agency tasked
with administering educational assessment and qualifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both organisations have been working towards enabling electronic examinations,
with NZQA showing positive results in adoption rate of e-Examinations by
schools. The session brought together senior leadership from both organisations,
including NZQA's Chief Executive, Mr Grant Klinkum, Deputy Chief Executive,
Ms Jann Marshall, and Chief Examinations Operating Officer, Ms Sheryl Ching.&nbsp;
SEAB was represented by Chief Executive, Mr Yue Lip Sin, along with Directors
of Assessment Planning and Development Division, Mr Tan Kuo Cheang and
Mr Pek Wee Haur, Director of Exam Operations Division, Mr Pang Chong Han,
Director of Research and Development Division, Mr Kelvin Lim, and other
staff members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the discussion, SEAB shared about electronic examinations (e-Examinations),
highlighting our change management strategies for e-Examinations transition,
development of accessible and inclusive e-Examinations, and operational
transformation initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both organisations shared their experiences and strategies in maintaining
examination standards while leveraging technology to enhance efficiency.
The conversation also covered emerging trends and possibilities in educational
assessment including automated marking systems. Both organisations also
shared their respective approaches to modernising examination systems while
ensuring quality and integrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This engagement has provided valuable insights into digital assessment
transformation and reinforced the importance of international collaboration
in educational assessment.&nbsp;</p>
