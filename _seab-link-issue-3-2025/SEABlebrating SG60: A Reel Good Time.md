<p>Joyous cheers and laughter filled the air on 7 August 2025 as SEAB commemorated
Singapore's 60th National Day with an extraordinary celebration. The day
was brimming with enthusiasm as SEAB staff came together to honour our
nation’s milestone birthday. Aptly named “SEAB-lebrating SG60: A Reel Good
Time!”, the event brought SEAB staff together for a memorable two-part
celebration, beginning at SEAB premises in the morning and continuing with
an afternoon movie outing at Plaza Singapura.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Day Observance Ceremony began with the singing of the national
anthem and reciting of the pledge.&nbsp; During the SG60 – Our Stories
segment, the staff shared their heartwarming reflections on Singapore,
including personal experiences, hopes, and wishes for the nation.&nbsp;
To test everyone’s knowledge about Singapore, a fun quiz was conducted,
followed by SEAB’s own version of ‘Don’t Forget the Lyrics’, where participants
completed the lyrics of beloved National Day songs such as ‘We Will Get
There’, ‘Reach Out for the Skies’, and ‘Singapore Town’.&nbsp;</p>

several participants surprising colleagues with their hidden singing talents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The morning also saw the launch of SEAB's new ACE-IT-ALL cultural traits
by the Human Resource Department. This initiative introduced five key core
values: Agility, Collaboration, Empathy, Innovation, and Accountability.&nbsp;
To make the launch memorable, each staff received a thoughtfully curated
goody bag containing refreshments creatively represented each of these
traits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our very own SEAB talents performed ‘We Will Get There’, creatively
weaving in ACE-IT-ALL cultural traits, with SEAB staff clapping and singing
along to the rendition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highlight of the morning was a musical performance by talented students
from Woodgrove Primary School, who charmed everyone with a ukulele rendition
of the National Day song ‘Home’. The performance became even more special
when two SEAB staff members, Pamela Tan and Mr Shane Seah from the Corporate
Cluster, joined in with their voices, creating a heartwarming musical collaboration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of their performance, they were joined on stage by senior management
members, who handed out goody bags, much to the delight of the students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Energised and in high spirits, colleagues then headed to Plaza Singapura
for the afternoon segment, a movie screening of Jurassic Park: Rebirth.
Complimentary popcorn and drinks enhanced the cinema experience, giving
colleagues from different divisions an enjoyable opportunity to bond over
something new and exciting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the celebration was a memorable occasion for SEAB staff to come
together as one SEAB family, reflect on our nation’s journey over six decades,
and share in laughter, music, and camaraderie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
