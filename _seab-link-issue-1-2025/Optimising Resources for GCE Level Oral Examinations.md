<p>The GCE N(A)/N(T)/O/A-Level oral examinations have been streamlined, resulting
in a significant reduction in the overall number of examination days and
related resources.</p>
<p>GCE N(A)/N(T)/O-Level oral examinations have long been held in the afternoons,
taking up a total of 23 school days. Similarly, the GCE A-Level oral examinations
were also held over 10 school days in the afternoons. Since 2024, this
has now reduced to just three full days and nine afternoons for GCE N(A)/N(T)/O-Level
and for A-level, four full days and two afternoons.</p>
<p>A review was made in 2022 to reduce teachers’ workload and help schools
to optimise resources. With schools utilising the Home-Based Learning (HBL)
approach more extensively, this created an opportunity to introduce an
arrangement to conduct oral examinations in a short window of time, while
students do not lose curriculum time.</p>
<p>For the GCE A-Level oral examinations, all Junior Colleges (JC) and Millenia
Institute (MI) were divided into two groups and conducted examinations
over a three-day period, effectively reducing the oral period by seven
days for each group.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than reducing the number of oral examination days, the change resulted
in the following benefits:
<br>
<br>a. Free up teachers’ time and resources in schools, allowing for better
utilisation in teaching, learning and other school activities including
co-curricular activities, national school games and Singapore Youth Festival.
&nbsp;Oral examiners travel on fewer days to the examination centres, cutting
stress and carbon emissions as well.</p>
<p>b. Gain economies of scale with resource optimisation in terms of manpower
and spaces required, also reducing exam administrative load.</p>
<p>Prior to the implementation, engagement sessions with MOE and schools
were conducted in 2022 to gather feedback. Approval was obtained from MOE
for a phased implementation in 2024 and 2025, and school leaders were informed
of the implementation plan in 2023 followed by regular updates.</p>
<p>The successful implementation in 2024 is attributed to the strong support
and cooperation of schools and teachers.&nbsp; It could only be implemented
with the sufficient number of teachers as oral examiners. SEAB will complete
the implementation in 2025 with the GCE N(A)/N(T)/O-Level oral examinations
in a single window for all subjects (including the conduct of O-level Mother
Tongue Language with the rest).</p>
<p>The survey feedback from oral examiners was positive:</p>
<p><strong>95% Oral Examiners were happy with the new oral exam arrangement.</strong>
